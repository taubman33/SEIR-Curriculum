# Software Engineering Immersive - Technology Setup

## General Course Technology Requirements

For all of our courses, we recommend:

You have administrator privileges on your computer to be able to download required tools and systems.

- If you are using a computer where you do not have these privileges, you will need to download the tools listed under Systems and Tools prior to the start of class. 

Your laptop has a 13 inch screen or larger. 

- It is our experience that students using a laptop with an 11 inch screen have a harder time navigating the tools and systems during class. 

You have a Mac.

- If you are using a Windows computer, you will be unable to follow instructions-as-written for many installation processes. You can either research and follow instructions written for Windows during these installations, or set up [Linux Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/desktop) on your PC to follow Mac instructions.

The below hardware requirements are highly recommended for our courses:

- 1.6GH dual-core Intel Core i5 Processor (M1 chips are fine)
- Turbo Boost up to 2.7 GHz
- Intel HD Graphics 6000
- 8GB RAM
- 128 GB flash storage
- 15+ GB of free disk space 

If you are a PC user, we require that you use the most recent version of Windows in order to run the programs for our courses.

## SEI Tools

Your instructor may choose to remove or add tools to your course. It is important to confirm with them the necessary tools.

## Live Online Suggested Setup

You will need access to high-speed internet and a dedicated, quiet workspace where you feel comfortable focusing, preferably in a private room. 

You'll also need to have your own computer (a Mac is strongly recommended), and we recommend using an external monitor (ideally 28” or bigger).
