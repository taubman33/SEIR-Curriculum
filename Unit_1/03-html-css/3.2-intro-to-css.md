## 1. Setup

This lesson will continue to use the same Repl we used during the _Intro to HTML_ lesson - picking up right where we left off. 

## 2. Intro to Cascading Style Sheets

### What is CSS?

CSS is a web technology used to layout and style HTML documents.

The latest version, CSS3, can also provide some stylistic behaviors using CSS animations!

CSS enables us to separate the structure & content (HTML) of a document from its presentation.  This concept of *separation of concerns* is widespread throughout software development because it helps make programs more maintainable and provides better code reuse.

Like most skills related to development, your CSS skills will continually develop over time with each front-end project you're involved with.

### Basic CSS Syntax

The following graphic shows the basic syntax of a CSS rule:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/IoBhwOi.gif">

Let's discuss the individual components above:

- **Selectors**:
	- Used to target the element(s) to be styled.
	- Can range from simple to complex.
	- Multiple selectors are separated with commas.
- **Properties**:
	- There are over two hundred CSS properties that can be used to style the color, size, text, position, border, animation, etc. of elements.
- **Value**:
	- The value to apply to a property is, of course, specific to that property. For example, the CSS property, _font-family_, accepts values of names of fonts such as _Georgia_, _Helvetica_, etc. Other properties may have numeric values along with a type of unit assigned to them, for example, you might set the width of a border to _5px_.
- **Declaration**:
	- The combination of a _property_ and _value_, separated by a colon and ending with a semicolon, makes a _declaration_.

Let's add a CSS rule to add some sizing and a border around the To Do `<article>` elements:

```css
/* style.css */

article {
  height: 4rem;
  width: 20rem;
  border: 0.5rem solid orange;
}
```

The `rem` is a length unit representing the font size of the root (`<html>`) element. Most browsers default a `rem` to be equal to `16px`.

We will learn more about units as we write code together over time, however, feel free to check out the [docs on CSS values and units](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Values_and_units) when time permits.

With the above styling, our page looks something like this:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/TEPGm8f.png">

Time to learn about the CSS Box Model...

## 3. The CSS Box Model

News Flash: EVERYTHING you see on a web page is a BOX - a rectangle!

When the browser positions and "paints" the elements on the page, it does so according to the following four parts that each element has:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/wt3yR8Y.png">

### Content Area

The **Content Area** contains the actual content of the element including its text and other nested elements.

### Padding Area

The **Padding Area** separates the content from the element's border.

The thickness of the padding is set using the `padding-top`, `padding-right`, `padding-bottom`, `padding-left`, and shorthand `padding` properties.

Notice how our To Do content is touching the border?  We can change that by adding a bit of padding:

```css
article {
  height: 4rem;
  width: 20rem;
  border: 0.5rem solid orange;
  /* Add padding on all four sides */
  padding: 0.5rem;
}
```

### Border Area

The **Border Area** extends outside of the Padding Area. The outer edge of the border is outer most edge of the actual element.

The thickness of the borders are set using the `border-width` and shorthand `border` properties.

### Margin Area

The **Margin Area** is used to create an empty area between elements.

The size of the margin area is determined by the `margin-top`, `margin-right`, `margin-bottom`, `margin-left`, and shorthand `margin` properties.

Now let's add a bit of space between the `<article>` elements:

```css
article {
  height: 4rem;
  width: 20rem;
  border: 0.5rem solid orange;
  padding: 0.5rem;
  /* Add margin on all four sides */
  margin: 1rem;
}
```

Here's how things look after adding the `padding` and `margin`:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/TibUFkh.png">

## 4. The `box-sizing` CSS Property

By default, the `box-sizing` property is set to a value of `content-box` and results in the `height` and `width` properties sizing the Content Area.  Any padding and/or margin will extend beyond the specified `height` and `width`!

<details>	
<summary>
‚ùì Based on the default <code>box-sizing</code> described above and since we set a height of <code>4rem</code> on the <code>article</code> elements, what is the <strong>actual</strong> height of each <code>article</code>?
</summary>
<hr>

**`6rem`**

4rem + 2 X 0.5rem (padding) + 2 X 0.5rem (border)

<hr>
</details>

It's preferable to change `box-sizing` to the more intuitive `border-box` value so that the element's `width` and `height` include everything except the Margin Area.

In fact, most CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap, Materialize, etc., set the default on all elements as follows:

```css
/* Use the * (general selector) to target all elements */
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

With the above change, the `<article>` elements will now have an actual `height` of `4rem` and a `width` of `20rem` as "expected".

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/kkn9TcN.png">

## 5. CSS Properties

### Basic Properties

With over 200 CSS properties in existence, we could spend weeks learning just CSS!

However, let's take a bit of time to research some common properties...

**üëâ YOU DO: Click on the CSS Properties below to research their purpose and possible values that can be assigned (5 mins)**

- [font](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font)
- [border](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border)
- [display](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display)
- [color](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value)
- [background](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background)

### Shorthand Properties

[Shorthand Properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Shorthand_properties) are CSS properties that let you set the values of several individual CSS properties simultaneously.

The `font`, `border` and `background` properties above are examples of Shorthand Properties.

Using a shorthand property, a web developer can write more concise CSS.
  
A shorthand property groups properties of a common theme.  Here are some examples:

#### font
  
```css
p {
   font-style: italic;
   font-weight: bold;
   font-size: 12px;
   line-height: 14px;
   font-family: Helvetica;
}
```

The five lines of CSS declarations above can be merged into a single declaration as follows:

```css
p {
   font: italic bold 12px/14px Helvetica;
}
```

#### margin
  
```css
div {
   margin-top: 10px;
   margin-right: 5px;
   margin-bottom: 15px;
   margin-left: 25px;
}
```

The four lines of CSS declarations above can be merged into a single declaration as follows:
  
```css
div {
   margin: 10px 5px 15px 25px;
}
```
   
The above `margin` example specifies margins for all four sides (top, right, bottom & left - in that order).

A good word to help remember the ordering of these values is **TR**ou**BL**e (top-right-bottom-left).

## 6. Including a CSS Framework in a Web Page

There are numerous CSS Frameworks available that can improve the styling of our apps with little effort.

[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) is the most popular CSS Framework in existence.

It's easy to include Bootstrap in a project by simply adding an additional `<link>` to load its CSS via a [Content Delivery Network (CDN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network):

```html
<head>
  ...
  <title>Intro to HTML & CSS</title>
  <!-- Include Bootstrap -->
  <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.0/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" integrity="sha384-gH2yIJqKdNHPEq0n4Mqa/HGKIhSkIHeL5AyhkYV8i59U5AR6csBvApHHNl/vI1Bx" crossorigin="anonymous">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
```

> Be sure to add CSS Frameworks BEFORE your project's stylesheet(s) in case you want to override some of the framework's styling.

CSS Frameworks provide lots of predefined classes that can be added to elements.

Let's add Bootstrap's `container` class to the `<body>` so that the content no longer touches the edge of the page:

```html
<body class="container">
```

Adding Bootstrap certainly improved the aesthetics a bit:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/lHTmGss.png">

## 7. Adding Styles to a Web Page

There are three ways to add styling to a web page:

1. Inline Styles
2. Internal Stylesheets
3. External Stylesheets

These three techniques are not mutually exclusive, you can use one or more of them in the same webpage.

#### 1. Inline Styles

An **inline style** can be used to apply style to a single element using the `style` attribute.

The use of inline styling breaks our separation of concerns by mixing content with presentation and therefore should be avoided unless there's a good reason to do so, for example, when testing or debugging styles.

To demonstrate inline styling, let's use it to change the background color of the page:

```html
<body
  class="container"
  style="background-color: SeaShell;"
>
``` 

We just used a CSS [Named Color](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/named-colors-and-hex-equivalents/)" instead of using a RGB hex value. There's a link in the References section if you want to learn more about colors in CSS.

#### 2. Internal Stylesheet

The second of the three techniques we can use to add CSS is with **internal stylesheets**.

An **internal stylesheet** is created by using a `<style>` element nested within the document's `<head>` element.

Let's center the text on the `<h1>`:

```html
<head>
  ...
  <style>
    h1 {
      text-align: center;
    }
  </style>
</head>
```

Although an improvement over using inline styling, internal stylesheets are also not the preferred method to add styles to your web page. However, they can be handy for quick styling - like during a lesson üòÄ

#### 3. External Stylesheets

The last of the three techniques available to add styling is **external stylesheets**.

Styling a page using **external stylesheets** is considered a best practice because it provides the best separation of concerns, reusability and maintainability.

External stylesheets are loaded via the `<link>` element as we've already used to load _style.css_. 

### Precedence

When there's a conflict between two or more identical styles with the same specificity (see Further Study)...

The highest priority is given to inline styles using the `style` attribute.

Then, the loading order determines which style is applied - last one wins because the later style overrides the earlier one.  This is what they mean by **Cascading** Style Sheets.

</details> 

## 8. CSS Selectors

As shown earlier, the **CSS Selector** portion of a CSS rule, targets an element, or elements, to be styled.

### Basic Selectors

#### *element* Selector

This is how we could select all `<h1>` and `<h2>` tags:

```css
h1, h2 { ... }
```

**üëâ YOU DO: Style by Element (1 min)**

- Target the `<span>` element and make its text color `orange`.

<details>	
<summary>
Peek only if you must üòÄ
</summary>
<hr>

```css
span {
  color: orange;
}
```

<hr>
</details>

#### *ID* Selector

We can select an element by its `id` attribute by prefixing it with `#`:

```css
#id-name { ... }
```

**üëâ YOU DO: Style an Element by its `id` (1 min)**

- Target the `<section>` using its `id` and add the following CSS declarations:

    ```css
    margin-top: 1rem;
    border: 0.3rem dotted orange;
    border-radius: 0.5rem;
    ```
    Feel free to copy/paste the above

After completion, this is what the page should look like:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/DgkwNHD.png">

#### *class* Selector

Selects elements that match one of the values within the *class* attribute - yes, the *class* attribute accepts multiple space separated values!

To target elements with a given class, or classes, we prefix the name of the class with a period:

```css
/* Target all elements having the class of "my-class" */
.my-class { ... }  

/* Target all <span class="my-class"> elements */
span.my-class { ... }

/* Target all <li class="item special"> elements */
li.item.special { ... }  
```

**üëâ YOU DO: Style Using a Class (2 mins)**

1. In _index.html_ add a class of `todo-input` to the `<input>` element.
2. In _style.css_, target any `<input>` that has a class of `todo-input` and set a `margin-top: 2rem;`

<details>	
<summary>
Resist if you can üòÄ
</summary>
<hr>

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<input class="todo-input">
```

```css
/* style.css */

input.todo-input {
  margin-top: 2rem;
}
```

<hr>
</details>

#### *attribute* Selector

Selects elements based upon their attributes.

Less common, but handy at times:

```css
/* Matches elements that have a 'style' attribute */
[style] { ... }

/* Targets anchor tags with an 'href' set to "#about" */
a[href="#about"] { ... }
```

### Combinators

Combinators provide a powerful way to select elements based upon their relationship to other elements.

The most common combinator is the **descendant selector**.

We use the _descendant selector_ to target elements **nested** within another element, regardless of the depth of the nesting.

A _descendant selector_ is defined by using a _space_ character between two other selectors:

```css
/* This will match all <span> tags nested anywhere within an <h3> tags with a class of "sub-title" */
h3.sub-title span { ... }
```

The _child selector_ is similar to the _descendant selector_, except that it only matches elements that are **direct** children, that is, nested only one-level deep:

```css
/* Selects all <p> tags that are direct children of a <div> */
div > p {...}
```

> KEY POINT: The **last** component listed in a combination selector determines what is actually targeted!  For example, looking above, only `<p>` elements are selected, not the divs with a class of my-class.

Let's update the current `<article>` selector so that only `<article>` elements that are direct children of the `<section id="todos-container">` are selected:

```css
/* Update this... */
article {
  ...
}

/* To this... */
#todos-container > article {
  ...
}
```

A couple of less common combinators can be found in the Further Study section.

### Pseudo-classes

Pseudo-classes let you style elements not just based upon their class, type, id or position in the document, but also their state. For example, whether an<br>`<input type="checkbox">` element<br>is checked or not.

Pseudo-classes include `:hover`, `:active`, `:disabled`, `:empty`, `:first-child`, `:nth-child`, `:nth-of-type`, `:focus` and more!

We can also chain pseudo-classes for some extra big fun!

```css
li:nth-child(3):hover {
  ...
}
```

Let's use the `:hover` pseudo-class to change a To Do `<article>` element's background color, text color and cursor when the mouse is over it:

```css
article:hover {
  background-color: orange;
  color: white;
  cursor: pointer;
}
```

Here's a link to learn more about [pseudo-classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/pseudo-classes).

### CSS Selectors - Key Takeaways

CSS selectors provide enormous capability and flexibility to target any element(s) for styling!

CSS selectors allow us to target an element, or elements, without having to resort to assigning a bunch of id's.

In general, use classes when you want to apply the styling to multiple elements and use an id to style a single element.

## 9. Summary

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/HkWgCqO.gif">

Learning CSS, like much of coding, is a never-ending process and in this lesson, we've done slightly more than scratch the surface.

As you code, you will undoubtedly rely on the numerous resources available to you on the Internet. Hopefully, this lesson has provided you with some context to help you better understand the results returned by your web searches.

Lastly, Chrome's DevTools are invaluable in helping debug among other things, CSS.  [Here's a link to Google's docs that discuss inspecting and changing CSS](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/css/)

## 10. Further Study

### Specificity

*Specificity* is the means by which a browser decides which CSS rule gets applied when there is a conflict.  For example:

```css
.my-class {
    color: blue;
}

div {
    color: red;
}

<div class="my-class">What color am I?</div>
```

A conflict exists because the `<div>` matches both CSS selector rules.

The selector with the **highest** *Specificity* wins.

The specificity is based upon the following priorities, where _Priority A_ has higher specificity:

| Priority A | Priority B | Priority C | Priority D |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Inline Styling | IDs | Classes, Attributes & Pseudo-classes | Elements |

Internally, the browser computes a CSS Specificity as shown here:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/77mRdUh.jpg">

There is an exception to the concept of *specificity* known as the **!important** declaration.  Use of *!important* is not recommended because it can make debugging CSS more difficult than it already is. 

### Margin Collapsing

The top and bottom margins are sometimes combined into a single margin - this behavior is known as [margin collapsing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Box_Model/Mastering_margin_collapsing).

### Less Common Combinators

These combinators are not quite as common but can come in handy...

- The **adjacent sibling selector** (`+`)

	```css
	div + p {...}
	```

   Would select `<p>` tags only if they were preceded **immediately** by a `<div>` at the same level (sibling).

- The **general sibling selector** (`~`)

	Similar to the _adjacent sibling selector_, except that it targets **all** siblings, not just the adjacent one:

	```css
	div.my-class ~ p {...}
	```

	Would target all `<p>` tags that are siblings following a `<div>` with a class of "my-class".

### Pseudo-elements

Pseudo-elements style specified parts of an element.

Here are some examples:

- `p::first-letter`: Style the first letter of all `<p>` elements
- `p::first-line`: Style the first line of all `<p>` elements
- `::selection`: Style the part of an element that is selected by the user
- `.special::before`: Add content _before_ all elements with a class of `.special`
- `.special::after`: Add content _after_ all elements with a class of `.special`
