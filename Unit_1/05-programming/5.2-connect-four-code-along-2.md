## Code away!

Again, programming is as much art as science.

I'm going to be developing from scratch while following the process described in Guide on How to Build a Browser Game!

### Start with some HTML & CSS

Our goal is to code the HTML & CSS that results in a UI that looks like our wireframe.

We will need to add elements in **index.html** for the following from top to bottom:

- The heading
- The message
- The column "markers"
- The board
- The `[PLAY AGAIN]` button

If an element's content is going to come from the `render()` function, you may want to temporarily include mocked content in the HTML to help with layout and styling. However, once the content is being provided by the `render()` function, you should remove the mocked content from **index.html**.

Along the way, we'll code CSS in **style.css** to layout and style the UI.
