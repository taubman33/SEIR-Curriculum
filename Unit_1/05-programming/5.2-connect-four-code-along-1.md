# Let's Code Connect-Four!

## Intro

So far, we've covered the fundamentals of:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- The DOM

Now let's bring these technologies together and learn more about programming as we code the fun game of [Connect-Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four)!

As I code, I will be following the concepts we covered in the [Guide on How to Build a Browser Game](https://gist.github.com/jim-clark/6f1919291f6007b2c0b2c93d925d6bac).

In addition, I will be describing my thought process as we make programming decisions in regards to using data structures, coding functions, etc.

I hope you're as excited as I am - let's get started!

## Planning & Project Setup

### 1. Analyze the app's functionality

Hopefully, you're aware of how Connect-Four is played.

If not, you can read about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four), but in summary:

- It's a two-player game.
- The players alternate "dropping" their color disc into one of the seven columns.
- First player to have four in a row of their color wins.
- The four in a row can be either horizontal, vertical, or either of the two diagonals.

### 2. Determine the overall design (look & feel) of the app
	
Our game of Connect-Four is going to have a clean/minimalist UI.

### 3. Wireframe the UI
 
Wireframes provide a blueprint for the HTML & CSS.

They also help reveal what state variables need to be defined.

Here's the wireframe that will guide us today:

### 4. Pseudocode

Pseudocode outlines the app's logic using plain language. It provides a road map to writing the code itself.
   
I'll regularly be typing pseudocode as comments within the functions as I code.

### 5. Identify the application's state (application-wide data)
	
What information does the application need to "remember" throughout its execution?

Use the wireframe and pseudocode to help identify what state needs to be tracked.

### 6. Set up the project

To make it easier for you to submit this project and your instructional team to check it, we'll deviate from the setup instructions of the Guide on How to Build a Browser Game.

Create an HTML/CSS/JS-based Repl on [replit.com](https://replit.com/~) and name it **Connect-Four Game**.

### 7. **Organize the app's JS into sections**

Copy/paste the following comment headings to help you organize your app's code:

```js
/*----- constants -----*/


/*----- state variables -----*/


/*----- cached elements  -----*/


/*----- event listeners -----*/


/*----- functions -----*/

```

The above headings are gold!
