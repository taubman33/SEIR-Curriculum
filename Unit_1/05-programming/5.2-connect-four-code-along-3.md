### Initialize the State Variables

Declare, but don't initialize, the application-wide state variables.

The initialization of the variables to their "initial" state should be done within an `initialize()`, or similarly named function, e.g., `init()`.
	
Write that `init()` function.
	
Invoke `init()` to "kick off" the app.

Now that the `init()` function has initialized the state variables, the last line in `init()` should call `render();` to render that state to the DOM for the first time.
