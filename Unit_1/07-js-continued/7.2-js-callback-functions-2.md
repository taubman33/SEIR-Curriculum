## 5. ðŸ’ª Practice Exercise - Using the `filter` Iterator Method <small>(20 min)</small>

1. Create a new HTML/CSS/JS Repl in [replit.com](https://replit.com/~) and name it **Filter Method Practice**.

2. Copy and paste the following `cars` array into the repl:

    ```js
    const cars = [
      { make: 'Toyota', yrsOld: 5, mileage: 92399 },
      { make: 'Ford', yrsOld: 12, mileage: 255005 },
      { make: 'Ferrari', yrsOld: 9, mileage: 12966 },
      { make: 'Subaru', yrsOld: 9, mileage: 111266 },
      { make: 'Toyota', yrsOld: 2, mileage: 41888 },
      { make: 'Tesla', yrsOld: 3, mileage: 57720 }
    ];
    ```

2. Research the array [filter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter) method.  

    > ðŸ‘€ In summary, the `filter` method iterates over all of the elements in a source array and returns a new array containing zero or more of the elements from that source array. The callback function determines which elements are included in the new array - if it returns a truthy value, the element for that current iteration will be included.

3. Use the `filter` method to "select" the objects within the `cars` array that have been driven more than 20,000 miles per year:


	
	> Hint: Like `forEach`, the `filter` method will invoke the callback once for each element in the `cars` array. Note that each element is an object, so each time the callback is invoked, its parameter will hold an object with `make`, `yrsOld` & `mileage` properties.

4. Store the new array returned by `cars.filter(...)` in a variable named `wellDrivenCars`.

5. You may use either an anonymous or named function as the callback function provided to the `filter` method.

6. Finally, use the `forEach` method on the `wellDrivenCars` array to `console.log` each "car" object.
