## 5. Using Callbacks with Asynchronous Functions

[JavaScript's asynchronous programming model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous) is one of its more challenging concepts to learn, so don't despair if it takes a bit of time to understand.

Think of asynchronous programming as a way to allow multiple things to happen in a program at the same time...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/LjSUUXV.png">

Certain functions/methods are **designed** to be asynchronous because they take a long time to complete their task.

When an asynchronous function or method is called, it goes into the background to do its thing, allowing the remaining "synchronous" code to run to completion.

When the asynchronous operation has completed, it will call its callback function (or resolve its promise - yes, that's for another lesson).

Consider the following code:

```js
let sales;
console.log(sales);  //-> undefined

// Assume getSalesData is an asynchronous function.
// When run, it will wait in the "background"...
// and call its callback function when the data arrives
getSalesData(function(salesFromDB) {
  // Update sales variable when data arrives
  sales = salesFromDB;
}); 

console.log(sales);  //-> ???
```

<summary>
❓ What will be logged out in the second <code>console.log(sales)</code> above?
</summary>
<hr>

<code>undefined</code> because <code>getSalesData()</code> will wait in the background until the data from the database, meanwhile, the remaining synchronous code runs.

<hr>
</details>

For a better understanding of asynchronous code, we'll start by confirming what **synchronous** code is...

### Synchronous Code Execution

So far, we've taken for granted that the code we write runs line by line and if we call a function/method, it finishes before the next line of code runs, i.e., it executes synchronously.

For example:

```js
const colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue'];

console.log('Code BEFORE the forEach...');

colors.forEach(function(color, idx) {
  console.log(`${idx + 1} - ${color}`);
});

console.log('Code AFTER the forEach...');
```
Running the above results in this expected output:

```
Code BEFORE the forEach...
1 - red
2 - green
3 - blue
Code AFTER the forEach...
```

Now let's see what asynchronous operations look like...

### Asynchronous Code Execution

Until we start working with databases, etc., we can use the asynchronous [setTimeout()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/setTimeout) & [setInterval()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/setInterval) functions which, when called, wait in the background until a specified amount of time elapses, then they call their callback functions.

Let's see `setTimeout()` in action:

```js
const colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue'];

console.log('Code BEFORE the forEach...');

// setTimeout accepts a callback & how long to wait before calling the cb
setTimeout(function() {
  colors.forEach(function(color, idx) {
    console.log(`${idx + 1} - ${color}`);
  });
}, 1000);  // 1000 milliseconds (1 sec)

console.log('Code AFTER the forEach...');
```

Running the above results in different output than the synchronous version:

```
Code BEFORE the forEach...
Code AFTER the forEach...
1 - red
2 - green
3 - blue
```

### A Fun Asynchronous Example

The code below demonstrates how `setTimeout` and callback functions can be used to implement the scenario where we need to:

- Do something...
- Wait for some period of time...
- Do something else...
- Wait for some period of time...
- etc.

Let's say we wanted a traffic light to cycle between Red, Green & Yellow lights with each light turned on for a certain amount of time:

- Red light on for 3 seconds
- Green light on for 2 seconds
- Yellow light on for 1 second

First, let's copy/paste the HTML into **index.html**:

```html
<body>
  <!-- add the following HTML -->
  <main>
    <div></div> <!-- red -->
    <div></div> <!-- yellow -->
    <div></div> <!-- green -->
  </main>
```

Now for some CSS:

```css
body {
  height: 100vh;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}

main {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 20vmin;
  grid-template-rows: repeat(3, 20vmin);
  border: 2px solid grey;
}

main div {
  margin: 2vmin;
  border-radius: 50%;
  border: 2px solid grey;
}
```

> REMINDER: Expect the following asynchronous code to be difficult to understand.  However, the following example will come in handy if you choose to do a game like _Simon_ or _Concentration_ that require timing/sequencing.

For the JavaScript, let's start by defining a flexible data structure that makes it easy to modify the functionality (color and time):

```js
// Using a "lookup" data-structure
// minimizes code and increases flexibility
const lightSequence = [
  {color: 'red', time: 3000},
  {color: 'green', time: 2000},
  {color: 'yellow', time: 1000}
];
```

Next, cache the light `<div>`s and define a variable to track the current light:

```js
// Cache the divs for the lights
const lightEls = document.querySelectorAll('main > div');

// Variable to track the current light
let curLightIdx = 0;  // Start with red object
```

Now for the function responsible for displaying the current light and letting its caller know when the time has expired for the light:

```js
function renderLight(cb) {
  // First, turn off all lights
  lightEls.forEach(el => el.style.backgroundColor = 'black');
  // Next, turn on the current light
  lightEls[curLightIdx].style.backgroundColor = lightSequence[curLightIdx].color;
  // Invoke the callback when this light's time has expired
  setTimeout(cb, lightSequence[curLightIdx].time);
}
```

Finally, a function that increments the `curLightIdx` and calls `renderLight` while passing itself as a callback:

```js
function renderLightSequence() {
  renderLight(renderLightSequence);
  // Increment and reset to zero when 3 is reached
  curLightIdx = ++curLightIdx % 3;
}

// Make it start!
renderLightSequence();
```

Very cool!

Let's wrap up with some questions!

## ❓ 7. Essential Questions <small>(2 mins)</small>

<details>
<summary>
(1) If asked in a job interview, "What's a callback function?" - what would a good answer be?
</summary>
<hr>

A function that's passed as an argument to another function.

<hr>
</details>

<details>
<summary>
(2) Are callback functions are defined differently than non-callback functions?
</summary>
<hr>

No

<hr>
</details>

```js
document.getElementById('items')
  .addEventListener('click', handleClick());
```
<details>
<summary>
(3) Is the code above likely to work as expected?
</summary>
<hr>

No, because the callback function, <code>handleClick</code>, is accidentally being invoked.

<hr>
</details>

<details>
<summary>
(4) Is the <code>addEventListener</code> method a <em>higher-order function</em>?
</summary>
<hr>

Yes, because it accepts a function as an argument. As a reminder, a function is also considered to be a higher-order function if it returns a function.

## 8. Further Study

### The Browser's Event Loop

Here's a great video on how asynchronous operations, such as the handling of events, do their business and notify JavaScript when their work is done.

[The Event Loop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCOL7MC4Pl0) (in this video, the amazing and funny Jake Archibald from Google does an amazing job demonstrating the browser's event loop).

### Event Loop & Queue Animation

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/OdITAWk.gif">

There are browser "Web APIs" that keep track of events, setTimeouts, etc.

For example, when we call `setTimeout()`, the browser keeps track of the timing, then when the time expires, it will place the setTimeout's callback function in the callback/event queue to be executed as soon as there are no other functions running in the call stack.
