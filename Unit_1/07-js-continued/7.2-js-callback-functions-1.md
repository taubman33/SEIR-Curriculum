## 1. Setup

Create a new HTML/CSS/JS Repl in [replit.com](https://replit.com/~) and name it **Callback Functions**.

## 2. What's a Callback Function?

**A callback function, is a function that's passed to another function as an argument.**


```js
function higherOrderFunction(callbackFunction) {
  // Sooner or later...
  callbackFunction();
}
```

A bit more vocabulary... A function that **accepts** a function as input and/or returns a function is known as a **higher-order function**.

**Callback functions** are not a new type of function, they are defined just like any other function (as a declaration, expression or arrow function).

Typically, the higher-order function accepts a callback for the purpose of invoking it at least once at some point in time.

Since you've previously used the array `forEach` method, you've already passed callback functions...

```js
colors.forEach(function(color, idx) {
   ...
});
```

Although using **anonymous functions** as callbacks is convenient, it's not uncommon to use a **named function** for code organization, for example:

```js
document.getElementById('todo-container')
  .addEventListener('click', handleTodoClick);
```
Or when the callback might be called from more than just one point in the code, for example:

```js
/*-- Event Listeners --*/
document.getElementById('replay-btn').addEventListener('click', init);

/*-- Functions --*/
init();

function init() {
  // Initialize state and call render
}
```

**üëÄ Be careful not to invoke the callback when passing it**, i.e., do not put parenthesis after the function! Otherwise, you'll be passing the result returned by that function instead of the function itself. For example, don't do this:

```js
document.getElementById('todo-container')
  .addEventListener('click', handleTodoClick());
  //                       No parens please ^^
```

### ‚ùì Review Questions - Callback Functions (1 min)

<details>
<summary>
(1) What's a callback function?
</summary>
<hr>

A function that's passed as an argument to another function<br>
(usually to be called by that function at least once at some point) 

<hr>
</details>

```js
const colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue'];
  
colors.forEach(function(color, idx) {
  console.log(`${idx + 1} - ${color}`);
});
```

Refer to the above code when answering the next two questions...

(2B) How many times will the higher-order function, <code>forEach</code>, invoke the callback?
</summary>
<hr>

<strong>3</strong><br>
(once for each element in the array)

</details>

## 3. Why are Callbacks Needed?

There are two scenarios that require the use of callbacks:

1. Certain functions & methods, by design, need a block of code in order to perform their purpose. For example, both `forEach` & `addEventListener` need a block of code to run and callback functions provide that code.

2. Certain higher-order functions/methods execute asynchronously in the background and are designed to invoke callback functions when they have finished their task. More on this later in this lesson.

## 4. Using Callbacks with Array Iterator Methods

One of the most popular use cases for callback functions is to provide them to iterator methods on arrays.

The `forEach` method we've been using is a perfect example and has been designed to:

1. Accept a callback function as an argument, and
2. Invoke that callback once for each element in the array

There are several other very useful Array iterator methods that we'll cover later this week - you can take a peek [here](https://gist.github.com/jim-clark/843ebb5288d90da6b0dfd9eecd134b7c) for a preview.
