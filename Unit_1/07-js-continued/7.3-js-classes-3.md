## 6. üí™ Practice Exercise - Defining Another Class <small>(15 min)</small>

As you know, the game of Tic-Tac-Toe consists of 9 "squares" - what a great opportunity for another class!

1. Create a fork (copy) of the current repl

    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/ujILa87.png">

2. **Before** the `TicTacToeGame` class, define a skeleton `Square` class. 
3. Add a `constructor` method with a parameter named `domElement`.
4. Code the `constructor` method so that it creates the following two properties:
    - `domElement`: Initialized to the `domElement` parameter.
    - `value`: Initialized to `null` but ultimately will hold player values of `1`/`-1`.
5. Define a **static** property named `renderLookup` used to determine what color to render for which value. Assign the following object (use whatever colors you wish):
    ```js
    {
      '1': 'purple',
      '-1': 'orange',
      'null': 'darkgrey'
    }
    ```
6. Square objects should be responsible for rendering themselves.  Define a `render` method with the following code line of code:
    ```js
    this.domElement.style.backgroundColor = Square.renderLookup[this.value];
    ```
    > üëÄ Note how we access a class's static property via the name of the class
7. Back in the `TicTacToeGame` class, update the commented out line<br>`// this.squares = ???;`<br>in the `play` method so that assigns instances of your new `Square` class to `this.squares`.  
    ```js
    this.squares = this.squareEls.map(el => new Square(el));
    ```
    > üëÄ The [Array.prototype.map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map) iterator method is perfect for transforming an array of elements into a new array of something else. We'll learn about it soon.
8. Update the `initialize()` function so that it calls `game.play()` after the `game` object has been created.
9. Outside of the classes, select the **[PLAY AGAIN]** button and add a click event listener to it that simply calls the `initialize` function.
10. Test it out by refreshing - resulting in the "empty" squares rendering with a dark grey background!

## 7. Finish the Game Logic

You're familiar with the Tic-Tac-Toe solution code, so let's finish off the game by copying/pasting over some code.

All of the below refactoring is in the `TicTacToeGame` class...

Update the `constructor` method to add a delegated event listener to the `boardElement`...

```js
constructor(boardElement, messageElement) {
  this.boardElement = boardElement;
  this.messageElement = messageElement;
  this.squareEls = [...boardElement.querySelectorAll('div')];
  // NEW CODE BELOW
  // Attach a delegated event listener
  // Arrow function is necessary to ensure 'this'
  // is set to the game object
  this.boardElement.addEventListener('click', (evt) => {
    // Obtain index of square
    const idx = this.squareEls.indexOf(evt.target);
    // Guards
    if (
      // Didn't click <div> in grid
      idx === -1 ||
      // Square already taken
      this.squares[idx].value ||
      // Game over
      this.winner
    ) return;
    // Update the square object
    this.squares[idx].value = turn;  // common typo 
    // Update other state (turn, winner)
    this.turn *= -1;
    this.winner = this.getWinner();
    // Render updated state
    this.render();
  });
}
```

Gonna need that `getWinner` method we just called!

Add the `getWinner` method - right above the `render` method will do...

```js
getWinner() {
  // Shortcut variable
  const combos = TicTacToeGame.winningCombos;
  for (let i = 0; i < combos.length; i++) {
    if (Math.abs(this.squares[combos[i][0]].value + this.squares[combos[i][1]].value + this.squares[combos[i][2]].value) === 3)
      return this.squares[combos[i][0]].value;
  }
  // Array.prototype.some iterator method!
  if (this.squares.some(square => square.value === null)) return null;
  return 'T';
}
```

Only rendering remains!

Replace the `render` method so that it "tells" the squares to render themselves and renders a message above the board...

```js
render() {
  // Square objects are responsible for rendering themselves
  this.squares.forEach(square => square.render());
  // NEW CODE BELOW
  if (this.winner === 'T') {
    this.messageElement.innerHTML = 'Rats, another tie!';
  } else if (this.winner) {
    this.messageElement.innerHTML = `Player ${this.winner === 1 ? 1 : 2} Wins!`;
  } else {
    this.messageElement.innerHTML = `Player ${this.turn === 1 ? 1 : 2}'s Turn`;
  }
}
```

There will be time to play later üòÄ

## 8. Inheritance

### Inheritance in OOP

In OOP, inheritance is when a new class is derived from an existing class for the purpose of "specializing" it by:
- Adding additional properties
- Adding additional methods
- Overriding existing methods

The newly derived class is called a  **derived** or **subclass**.

The original class is called a **base** or **superclass**.

A subclass automatically inherits all of the superclass's properties and methods - whether you want them all or not.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/MvXw4nD.gif" width="800">

For example, a `Payment` class could have `CreditCard` & `Cash` subclasses derived from it.

### Using the `extends` Keyword to Create a Subclass

Let's say we want to create a replacement for the `Square` class that renders images instead.

We use the `extends` keyword to define a subclass.

Be sure to add this new class below the existing `Square` class:

```js
class ImageSquare extends Square {
  // No new properties, so no reason to 
  // update the constructor

  // Override the inherited renderLookup
  static renderLookup = {
    '1': 'https://i.imgur.com/OrrI2Ab.png',
    '-1': 'https://i.imgur.com/eKFZUa2.png',
    'null': 'darkgrey'
  };

  // Override the inherited render
  render() {
    if (this.value) {
      this.domElement.style.backgroundImage = `url(${ImageSquare.renderLookup[this.value]})`;
    } else {
      this.domElement.style.backgroundImage = '';
    }
  }
}
```

With the `ImageSquare` class ready for use, let's refactor `TicTacToeGame` to use it instead of the `Square` class:

```js
play() {
    // Initialize the game's state
    // In instance methods, 'this' will be the 
    // actual instance (object)
    this.squares = 
      // Use the new ImageSquare!
      this.squareEls.map(el => new ImageSquare(el));
      // this.squareEls.map(el => new Square(el));
  ...
}
```

Aww...

### Adding Additional Properties to a Subclass

In addition to overriding and adding methods in a subclass, **additional** properties can be initialized in the `constructor`.

To demonstrate, let's say that we want to rotate the cat and dog images once every x number of seconds.

First, let's update the `constructor` in `ImageSquare` to allow for the number seconds per rotation to be passed in when instantiating the class:

```js
class ImageSquare extends Square {
  // Additional parameters must always be defined
  // after the parameters of the superclass
  constructor(domElement, secondsPerRotation = 0) {
    // Always initialize the superclass first
    super(domElement);
    // Specialize!
    this.domElement.style.animationDuration = `${secondsPerRotation}s`;
  }
  ...
```

The [super](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/super) keyword is used to access properties of the superclass or invoke the superclass's `constructor` like above.

Now we just have to update the `play` method in `TicTacToeGame` to pass in the number of seconds at the time of instantiation:

```js
play() {
    // Initialize the game's state
    // In instance methods, 'this' will be the 
    // actual instance (object)
    this.squares = 
      // Rotate once every 3 seconds
      this.squareEls.map(el => new ImageSquare(el, 3));
      // this.squareEls.map(el => new Square(el));
  ...
}
```

Have fun!

## 10. Further Study

### Example DOM Node Class Hierarchy

In complex systems, it's not uncommon to have several layers of inheritance - referred to as an object hierarchy:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/JUFoRzu.png">

### Subclass JavaScript's Built-In Classes

It's possible to use `extends` to subclass JS's built-in classes.

For example, it would be nice to have `last` property on arrays that return's the last element of the array:

```js
class MyArray extends Array {
  get last() {
    return this[this.length - 1];
  }
}
```

You then would need to instantiate the `MyArray` class to create the specialized array:

```js
const nums = new MyArray(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
console.log(nums.last); //-> 5
```

All other array properties and methods are available due to inheritance!

### Prototypal Inheritance and the Prototype Chain 

Learn more about prototypal inheritance and the prototype chain [here in the docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain).

### Constructor Functions - B.C. (before classes üòÄ)

Before classes arrived via ES2015, we used _constructor functions_ to do the exact same thing as classes.

There's no doubt that new code today is going to be written using the `class` keyword.

However, older code would would have had to use _constructor functions_, so let's look at how the `TicTacToeGame` class can be written as a constructor function instead:

```js
function TicTacToeGame(boardElement, messageElement) {
  // Same code as the class's constructor method
}
TicTacToeGame.prototype.play = function() {
  // Same code as the play method
};
// other 'prototype' (instance) methods defined like above
  
// Instantiation is identical
let game = new TicTacToeGame(boardEl, msgEl);
```

Static methods would be created directly on the constructor function:

```js
TicTacToeGame.about = function() {
  // ...
};
```
