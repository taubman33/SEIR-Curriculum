## 6. ðŸ’ª Practice Exercise - Defining Another Class <small>(15 min)</small>

As you know, the game of Tic-Tac-Toe consists of 9 "squares" - what a great opportunity for another class!

1. Create a fork (copy) of the current repl

2. **Before** the `TicTacToeGame` class, define a skeleton `Square` class. 
3. Add a `constructor` method with a parameter named `domElement`.
4. Code the `constructor` method so that it creates the following two properties:
    - `domElement`: Initialized to the `domElement` parameter.
    - `value`: Initialized to `null` but ultimately will hold player values of `1`/`-1`.
5. Define a **static** property named `renderLookup` used to determine what color to render for which value. Assign the following object (use whatever colors you wish):
    ```js
    {
      '1': 'purple',
      '-1': 'orange',
      'null': 'darkgrey'
    }
    ```
6. Square objects should be responsible for rendering themselves.  Define a `render` method with the following code line of code:
    ```js
    this.domElement.style.backgroundColor = Square.renderLookup[this.value];
    ```
    > ðŸ‘€ Note how we access a class's static property via the name of the class
7. Back in the `TicTacToeGame` class, update the commented out line<br>`// this.squares = ???;`<br>in the `play` method so that assigns instances of your new `Square` class to `this.squares`.  
    ```js
    this.squares = this.squareEls.map(el => new Square(el));
    ```
    > ðŸ‘€ The [Array.prototype.map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map) iterator method is perfect for transforming an array of elements into a new array of something else. We'll learn about it soon.
8. Update the `initialize()` function so that it calls `game.play()` after the `game` object has been created.
9. Outside of the classes, select the **[PLAY AGAIN]** button and add a click event listener to it that simply calls the `initialize` function.
10. Test it out by refreshing - resulting in the "empty" squares rendering with a dark grey background!
