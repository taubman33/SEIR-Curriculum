## Setup

Create a new Node.js-based Repl in [replit.com](https://replit.com/) and name it **JS Arrays**

## 1. The Use Case (What & Why) of Arrays

### What are Arrays?

- [Arrays](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array) are an extremely popular data structure used store an ordered "list" of data.
- Arrays can contain zero or more items called - **elements** (not to be confused with HTML elements).
- Each element in an array can hold any data type including objects, functions, even other arrays.
- Although we often may refer to Arrays as a **data type**, they are actually a subtype of the JS Object, i.e., Arrays are Objects in JS.
- It is a best practice to name array variables plurally, e.g.,<br> `let colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue'];`

### Why use Arrays?

- Arrays are the data structure of choice for holding ordered lists of data.
- Without data structures like arrays (and data types like objects), we wouldn't have a way to store "collections" of data, which we commonly need to do.

## 2. Creating Arrays

There are two ways to create an array...

```js
// using Array Literal Notation (recommended best practice)
const nums1 = [2, 4, 18];

// using the Array class (less common approach)
const nums2 = new Array(2, 4, 18);
```

The best practice is to use _Array Literal Notation_ because it's more concise and the class approach behaves differently if you pass only one argument.

### ðŸ‘‰ You Do: Creating Arrays (1 min)

- Assign an array containing three of your favorite movies (strings) to a variable named `movies`.

## 3. Accessing/Updating the Elements in an Array

We access and update elements in an array using **square bracket notation**, passing in the "index" (position) of the element you want to access:

```js
let movies = ['Caddyshack', 'Interstellar', 'Moonraker'];
// Access the value of the first element ('Caddyshack')
// and assign to a variable named firstMovie
let firstMovie = movies[0];
// Let's update the 3rd movie (index of 2)
movies[2] = 'Contact';  
```

Note that indexes are integers where `0` is used to access the first element.

> Why is `0` instead of `1` the index for the first element you ask?  This "zero-based" indexing for sequences like arrays and strings is common in programming languages due to the fact that they prefer to work with "offsets" in memory. Thus, we access the first item using an offset of zero.

To access the last element in an array we need to know how many elements the array has and subtract `1` - this is where the [length](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/length) property comes in handy:

```js
// lastMovie's value will be the string 'Contact'
let lastMovie = movies[movies.length - 1];
```

Unfortunately, JavaScript does not have negative indexing (index from the end of the array) that some languages like Python have - this is due to the fact that Arrays are objects in JS.  For example, the following expression would return `undefined`:

```js
movies[-1]  //-> undefined
```

## 4. Adding Elements to an Array

We can add elements to the **end** of an array using the [push](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/push) method:


```js
// Let's add a movie to the end of the array
movies.push('Jaws');
```

We can also add elements to the **front** of an array with [unshift](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/unshift):


```js
// Let's add a couple of more movies, but
// to the front of the array this time
movies.unshift('Star Wars', 'Jurassic Park');
```

Note that both `push()` and `unshift()` methods can accept multiple values and return the new length of the array.

## 5. Removing Elements from an Array

We can remove a **single** element from the **end** of an array using the [pop](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/pop) method:

```js
// Remove Jaws (last element)...
let movie = movies.pop();
```

We can also remove from the **front** of an array using the [shift](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/shift) method:

```js
// movie will now hold 'Star Wars'
movie = movies.shift();
```

The `pop()` and `shift()` methods only remove one element at a time, return that element and don't take any arguments.

### Remembering `unshift` & `shift`

It's fairly easy to remember what `push` & `pop` do because of their names ("push" in, "pop" out).

However, `unshift` & `shift` are are not as clear.

Maybe this will help you remember:

```
The "longer" named methods do the same thing (add to an array)
unshift -> [...] <- push

The "shorter" named ones remove
shift <- [...] -> pop
```

### Add/Remove Elements To/From Anywhere in the Array

The `splice()` method is capable of **adding and/or removing** any number of elements to/from an array with a single line of code!

If we check [the docs splice](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/splice) we'll find the syntax to be:

```js
array.splice(start, deleteCount, newItem1, newItem2...)
```

Note that all but the first parameter is optional.

> The `Array.prototype.splice()` notation in the docs denotes that `splice` is a "prototype" method that's callable on an instance of the class (an array object in this case).  Don't worry, more on this topic in future lessons.

Here's my current `movies` array at this point:

```js
movies //-> ['Jurassic Park', 'Caddyshack', 'Interstellar', 'Contact']
```

#### Using `splice()` to Remove Element(s)

```js
// Remove 'Caddyshack' & 'Interstellar'
let removedMovies = movies.splice(1, 2);
// movies -> ['Jurassic Park', 'Contact']
// removedMovies -> ['Caddyshack', 'Interstellar']
```

#### Using `splice()` to Insert Element(s)

```js
// Insert 'Spaceballs' & 'Alien' after 'Jurassic Park'
removedMovies = movies.splice(1, 0, 'Spaceballs', 'Alien');
// movies -> ['Jurassic Park', 'Spaceballs', 'Alien', 'Contact']
// removedMovies -> [] (empty array)
```

#### Using `splice()` to Replace Element(s)

```js
// Replace 'Jurassic Park' & 'Spaceballs' with 'Best In Show'
removedMovies = movies.splice(0, 2, 'Best In Show');
// movies -> ['Best In Show', 'Alien', 'Contact']
// removedMovies ->Â ['Jurassic Park', 'Spaceballs']
```

As you saw, the `splice` method always returns an array containing the removed elements (an empty array if no elements were removed).

### ðŸ‘‰ You Do: Use `splice()` (1 min)

Here's my current `movies` array:

```js
movies //-> ['Best In Show', 'Alien', 'Contact']
```

- Use `splice()` to **replace** 'Contact' with 'The Matrix' & 'Gladiator'

Afterwards, this will be the `movies` array:

```js
movies //-> ['Best In Show', 'Alien', 'The Matrix', 'Gladiator']
```

## 6. Iterating Over All of the Elements in an Array

### Using the `forEach` Iterator Method

Although a `for` loop can be used to iterate over an array, if we want to iterate over **all** of the elements in an array, the [forEach](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach) iterator method is a better approach because it more clearly communicates the developer's intention:

Let's try it out:

```js
movies.forEach(function(movie) {
  console.log(movie);
});
```

...will result in the following output:

```
Best In Show
Alien
The Matrix
Gladiator
```

As you can see, the `forEach` method calls the function provided as an argument **once for each element** in the array.
	
If you need to know the index of the current iteration, the `forEach` method also happens to pass in the index as a second argument, for example:

```js
movies.forEach(function(movie, idx) {
  console.log(idx + ' - ' + movie);
});
```

...will result in the following output:

```
0 - Best In Show
1 - Alien
2 - The Matrix
3 - Gladiator
```

It's a **best practice** to name the first parameter that accepts each element as the singular version of the name of the array, or simply the first letter of the array variable (`movie` or `m` for the example above).

### Using a `for...of` Loop

ES2015 provides the `for...of` loop for iterating over the elements of arrays and other iterables such as strings:

```js
for (let movie of movies) {
  if (movie === 'The Matrix') break;
  console.log(movie);
}
```

...will result in the following output because once `movie` is assigned 'The Matrix', the `if` statement will result in exiting the `for` loop thanks to the `break` statement:

```
Best In Show
Alien
```

Whereas the `forEach` method always iterates over every element, the `for...of` loop can be exited using the [break](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/break) statement.
