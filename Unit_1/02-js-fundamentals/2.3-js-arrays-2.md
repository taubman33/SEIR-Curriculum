## 7. ðŸ’ª Practice Exercise - Arrays (10 mins)

Let's practice creating, modifying and iterating over an array!

1. Create a new Node.js-based Repl in [replit.com](https://replit.com/) and name it **JS Array Practice** 
2. Assign an empty array to a variable named `books`.
3. Add **'The Shining'** to the `books` array.
4. Add **'Moby Dick'** to the **front** of `books`.
5. `console.log` the second element of `books`.
6. Update the second element by assigning to it **'Dune'**.
7. Insert **'Great Expectations'** as a new second element (between 'Moby Dick' & 'Dune').
    > Hint: splice!
8. Iterate over the entire `books` array and `console.log` each book string.

I'll code a solution when we return.
