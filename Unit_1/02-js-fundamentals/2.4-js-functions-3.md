## 4. üí™ Practice Exercise - Write a Function Expression (10 min)

Write a function named `planetHasWater` as a **function expression**.

It will have one parameter, `planet`, that accepts a string argument.

Return `true` if the `planet` argument is either 'Earth' or 'Mars', otherwise return `false`.

Bonus: Make the function work regardless of the casing of the planet string being passed in ('earth', 'MARS', etc.).

Invoke the function a few times to test it:

```js
console.log( planetHasWater('Earth') ) //=> true
console.log( planetHasWater('Venus') ) //=> false
// Test the bonus...
console.log( planetHasWater('mArS') ) //=> true
```

## 5. More About Parameters & Arguments

So, let's answer a common question:
>  _"What's the difference between a parameter and an argument?"_

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/u5p9n7m.jpg">
	
Arguments are the data being passed to the function.

Arguments are assigned to the parameters positionally. In the example above, the `bottle` parameter would be assigned the string "green bottle" because they are the first parameter and argument.

Parameters become local variables inside the statement body of the function. Therefore, in the example above, `bottle` and `cap` are variables that can be accessed (and even updated) from anywhere within the function.
  
Just as when naming variables and functions, it's important to name parameters using identifiers that are representative of the data being passed to them.

### Functions as Arguments

In JavaScript, functions are passed around and treated like data because they are - they're objects!

A function is a JS expression, so they can be used anywhere an expression is expected, i.e., as arguments, returned from another function, etc.
  
### Passing an Anonymous Function

Certain functions and methods (functions attached to an object) require that a function be provided as an argument.

For example, the `forEach` method on arrays:
	
```js
const colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue'];
	
colors.forEach(function(color) {
  console.log(color);
});
```
	
Since the function provided to the `forEach` will never be called from anywhere else in the code, we don't need to bother to create a separate named function and pass it in.

Anonymous functions like shown above are very convenient!

## 6. Further Study

### Fewer Arguments Than Parameters Defined

JavaScript is very flexible and won't complain when the number of arguments is not the same as the number of parameters defined.

If fewer arguments are passed than parameters defined, then the parameter variables without a matching argument would be set to `undefined`.

> Note: Unlike some other programming languages, JavaScript won't complain if fewer (or extra) arguments are passed to a function.  However, a function that depends on certain arguments to do its job might throw an error or return an unexpected result if it doesn't receive the arguments expected.

### Extra Arguments Than Parameters Defined

Let's pretend you need to write a function that accepts an unknown number of arguments.

For example, let's say we would like to be able to provide any number of "time" arguments to the `getPointsScored ` function we saw earlier and return a total number of points scored.

First, let's ignore the fact that typically we could code the function to accept an array of times, e.g.,

```js
function getPointsScored(elapsedTimes) {
  // code to iterate over the elapsedTimes array...
}
```

Here's how we could write `getPointsScored` to accept any number of individual "time" arguments using ES2015's [Rest parameters](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/rest_parameters):

```js
function getPointsScored(...times) {
  // times will be an array holding the args (see Rest Parameters in the docs)
  // Perfect use case for the Array.reduce method, but that's another day...
  let totalPoints = 0;
  times.forEach(function(time) {
    if (time < 30) {
      totalPoints += 100;
    } else if (time < 60) {
      totalPoints += 75;
      return 75;
    } else {
      totalPoints += 25;
    }
  });
  return totalPoints;
}
	
const points = getPointsScored(16, 99, 32, 60);
```

> Note:  Prior to ES2015, we would use the special [arguments](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/arguments) keyword available within non-arrow functions. `arguments` is a JS object that has a `length` property and allows its values to be accessed via _square bracket_ notation.

### ES2015 Default Parameters

What if your function requires certain arguments and you want to provide a default value for the parameter if an argument is not supplied when the function is invoked?

Prior to ES2015, here is trivial example of what we had to do:

```js
function setColor(bicycle, color) {
  // set color to 'purple' if not provided
  bicycle.color = color || 'purple';
}

const bike = new Bicycle();
setColor(bike, 'blue');  // sets color to blue
setColor(bike);  // sets color to purple by default
```
Now, using **default parameters**, we can do this:

```js
function setColor(bicycle, color = 'purple') {
  bicycle.color = color;
}
```

Any expression can be provided as a default, including objects, etc.

### Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE)

One way we can prevent our code from leaking into the global scope is by wrapping it with a construct known as an **Immediately Invoked Function Expression**, or "IIFE" (pronounced "iffy").  It looks like this:

```js
(function() {
  'use strict';

  // your code here...
	
})();
```

<details>	
<summary>
Why do IIFEs virtually prevent variables and functions from being created in the global scope?
</summary>
<hr>

Variables and functions defined within a function, including an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE), are scoped to that function, not global scope.

<hr>
</details>

### Nesting Functions

As the examples above have shown, we can define functions within functions!

Why would we want to do this? Well, Perhaps an outer function needs a "helper" function that would only be relevant only to a given function. It would be good programming practice to "hide" that function from the rest of the program by nesting it within the function that actually needs it.

For example (no need to execute this):

```js
function openNewAccount(name, openingBalance) {
  let acctNum = generateAcctNum();
  
  // createAccount is a function available outside this function
  let acct = createAccount(acctNum, openingBalance);
  return acct;
  
  // helper function that provides a unique account number
  function generateAcctNum() {
    return Date.now();  // super amazing algorithm :)
  }
}
```

As you can see, there's a nifty `generateAcctNum` function in there and it's only relevant to when a new account is opened, so it's nested within the `openNewAcount` function.
