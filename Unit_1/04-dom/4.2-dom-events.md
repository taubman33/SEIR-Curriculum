## 1. Setup

Once again, we will use an actual project structure instead of working within Replit.

### Create the Project Files

1. Move in your `code` folder/directory: `cd ~/code`
2. Create a new directory named `dom-events`:  `mkdir dom-events`
3. Move into the new directory: `cd dom-events`
4. Create an `index.html` file:  `touch index.html`
5. Open the directory in VS Code: `code .`
6. Open `index.html` in the editor and use `! [tab]` to create the HTML boilerplate
7. Create a `js` directory and touch a `js/main.js` file
8. Add a `<script>` tag to include `main.js` in the `<head>`:

	```html
	<head>
	  ...
	  <title>DOM Events</title>
	  <script defer src="js/main.js"></script>
	</head>
	```
	> The `defer` attribute ensures the DOM is ready before the script executes.
9. Finally, let's add an `<h1>` inside of the `<body>` as follows:

	```html
	...
	<body>
	  <h1 id="title" class="main-title">DOM Events</h1>
	  
	</body>
	</html>
	```

### View `index.html` in Live Server

Click "Go Live" in the status bar at the bottom of VS Code.

Live Server should automatically open `index.html` in a new browser tab:

## 2. What are DOM Events?

DOM events are the bedrock of interactivity on web pages.

DOM events enable us as developers to implement **event-driven programming**. This programming paradigm is such that much of our code runs in response to events being triggered during run-time (usually due to user interaction).

Lots of events are being generated within the browser, for example, when:

-  A user moves or clicks the mouse
-  A user presses a key
-  When a form is submitted
-  When the page has finished loading or has been resized
-  etc.

Take a peek [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events) the sheer number of events.

## 3. What's an Event Listener?

An **event listener** is a function, more specifically, a **callback function**, that is called when an event fires.

Event listeners may also be referred to as _event handlers_.

### How Are Event Listeners Are Added to DOM Elements?

The best practice approach to register an event listener is to use the [addEventListener()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener) method.

Here is the syntax for attaching an event listener for a given event:

```js
element.addEventListener(<event-name>, <callback>);
```
- **event-name** is the name of the event (string)
- **callback** is the function we want executed when the event happens.  When called by the JS engine, it will be passed an _event object_ as an argument.

## 4. Our first Event Listener

### Add Additional HTML

Let's add the following HTML to between the `<body>` tags in `index.html`:

```html
<h3>Comments</h3>
<ul>
  <li>SEI Rocks!</li>
</ul>
<input>
<button>Add Comment</button>
```

### Listen to the `click` Event on the `<button>`

We can add a `click` event listener to pretty much any element - not just buttons.  However, buttons are pre-styled to look and act clickable üòÉ

We're going to use an anonymous callback function in this first example:

```js
// Select the button
const btn = document.querySelector('button');
btn.addEventListener('click', function(evt) {
  // testing!
  console.log(evt);  
});
``` 

If all goes well, clicking the button should log out the **event object**.

Congrats, attaching your first event listener!

## 5. The Event Object

Examining the **event object** that was provided as an argument to our event listener reveals lots of useful information about the event!

Of special interest are:

- Several `...X` and `...Y` properties that provide where the click occurred.

- The `target` property, which holds a reference to the DOM element that triggered (dispatched) the event.

The `target` property will certainly be the one to remember as it will be used very often moving forward.

## 6. Adding a New Comment

### Application Logic

When we click the `[Add Comment]` button, we'll need our event listener function to do the following:

1. Create a new `<li>` element
2. Set the `<li>` element's `innerText` to that of the text entered in the `<input>`
3. Append the `<li>` to its parent, the `<ul>`
4. Finally, clear the text from the `<input>`

### Creating a New `<li>` Element

If we want to add a new comment to the DOM, we're going to need to create a new `<li>` element.

Here's how we can do it using the `document.createElement` method:

```js
btn.addEventListener('click', function(evt) {
  // Create a new <li> element
  const newCommentEl = document.createElement('li');
  console.log(newCommentEl)
});
```
> Note: At this point, the element is "in memory" only and is not part of the DOM (yet).

Okay, we have a new `<li>` element created and assigned to a variable named `newCommentEl`, but it has no content...

### Getting/Setting the Text of an `<input>`

We'll need to access the text the user has typed into the `<input>` element in order to set the `innerText` of `newCommentEl`.

Since `<input>` elements are **empty elements**, i.e., elements with no content, `innerText` and `innerHTML` properties do not exist.

Instead, we get and set the text within an `<input>` using the `value` property.

> NOTE: The `value` property maps to the `value` attribute in HTML.

Because this app needs to access the `<input>` every time the `<button>` is clicked, it would be more efficient to cache (a developer term for 'remember' or 'store') the `<input>` outside of the event handler function so that it isn't selected over and over:

```js
// Cached elements
const inputEl = document.querySelector('input');

btn.addEventListener('click', function(evt) {
  const newCommentEl = document.createElement('li');
  // Access the input's text
  const commentText = inputEl.value;
  console.log(commentText)
});
```

ü§î For future reference, remembering that we use the `value` property to get/set the text of an `<input>` element is worthwhile.

### Setting the Content of the `<li>`

So, now we can set the `innerText` of the new `<li>`:

```js
// Cached elements
const inputEl = document.querySelector('input');

btn.addEventListener('click', function(evt) {
  const newCommentEl = document.createElement('li');
  const commentText = inputEl.value;
  // Set newComment's text
  newCommentEl.innerText = commentText;
});
```

Now the new `<li>` is ready to be added to the DOM...

### Adding the `<li>` to the DOM

<details>
<summary>
‚ùì Which element do we we want to add the <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> to?
</summary>
<hr>

**The `<ul>`**

<hr>
</details>

There are a few ways to add DOM elements to the document using JavaScript.

One common way to add new elements to another element is by using the [append()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/append) method like this:

```js
// Cached elements
const inputEl = document.querySelector('input');
// Remember the <ul> too!
const ulEl = document.querySelector('ul');

btn.addEventListener('click', function(evt) {
  const newCommentEl = document.createElement('li');
  const commentText = inputEl.value;
  newCommentEl.innerText = commentText;
  // Add the new li as the ul's last child
  ulEl.append(newCommentEl);
});
```

Test it out - nice!

### Clearing the Text in the `<input>`

The new comment has been added, but if we want to improve the UX, we have one more task - clear out the `<input>`.

### üëâ YOU DO: Improve the UX (1 min)

- Clear the text in the `<input>` by adding one line of code.

  > Hint: What's the property that we used to _get_ the text?

## 7. Event Bubbling

When an event occurs on an element, that event _bubbles_ up through the DOM, all the way up to the `document` object.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/B7f5PAZ.png" width="90%">

All event listeners attached for the same event, such as `click`, will be invoked along the path to the `document` element - unless one of those listeners calls the **event object's** [stopPropagation()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/stopPropagation) method.

How can our apps benefit from this event bubbling?  Let's see...

## 8. Event Delegation

### What is Event Delegation

Imagine a web app, like a game perhaps, with lots of elements that need to respond to a click. It's possible there could be tens, hundreds or more of these elements.

That would be a lot of event listeners, wouldn't it - not very efficient at all.

Plus, every time a new element is added, an event listener would also have to be attached ü§¢

We can avoid this predicament by using a technique know as **event delegation**.

Event delegation allows us to attach an event listener to a single DOM element that can respond to events triggered by any of its **descendant** DOM elements.  Much more efficient!

### Implementing Event Delegation

Let's attach an event listener (this time we'll use a named function) on the `<ul>` that can respond to clicks on any of its nested `<li>` elements:

```js
ulEl.addEventListener('click', handleClick);

// Naming the function handleXxxxx is a great practice
function handleClick(evt) {
  console.log(evt.target);
}
```

> Important:  The event object's `target` property will be set to the **actual** element that was clicked!

Not only is event delegation more efficient, by it's very design, it's dynamic - as descendants are added, they too will be listened to!

### üëâ YOU DO: Event Delegation (2 mins)

Now that we have a delegated event listener in place, let's:

- Write the code to change the color of the text of a clicked comment to a color of your choosing.

  > Hint: DOM elements have a `style` property that's an object with the CSS properties (named using camel-casing), e.g., `someElement.style.fontSize`.

## 9. Removing Event Listeners

Although not usually necessary, it's possible to remove an event listener, but only if a named function was used as the callback.

This is how we could detach the event listener from the `<button>`:

```js
btn.removeEventListener('click', handleClick);
```

## 11: Further Study

### Less Useful Ways to Add Event Listeners

In addition to the `addEventListener()` method, there are two other ways to register event listeners:

- In the HTML (inline):<br>`<button id="reset-btn" onclick="reset()">`
- Assigning to DOM elements' properties:<br>`resetBtn.onclick = reset;` 

Using the HTML approach (`onclick="reset()"`) is typically frowned upon because it requires that the function be in the global scope. In addition, this, like inline styling, kind of breaks the **separation of concerns** design principle.

The DOM element approach (`resetBtn.onclick = reset;`) is better because the function does not have to be in global scope.

Note that the above two approaches are not the recommended best practice.
