# MERN-Stack Quick Notes Lab

## Intro

This lab will provide practice on the following tasks:

- Create a new MERN-Stack app by cloning the `mern-infrastructure` repo.
- Create and work with Mongoose Models.
- Implement user-centric User Stories in the MERN-Stack.
- Define components to render data using React.

#### This Lab is a Deliverable

## Setup

- Follow all of the steps in the _Using mern-infrastructure to Create MERN-Stack Projects in the Future_ section of the _MERN-Stack Infrastructure - Part 7_ lesson.

- Name both the project and your new GH repo `mern-quick-notes`.

## Instructions

Implement the User Stories below.

All layout and styling is at your discretion and is secondary to the application's functionality for this lab.

## The `Note` Model

The schema for notes will be minimal with only the following two properties:

| Property Name | Property Type | Validation(s) |
|---|---|---|
| `text` | `String` | required |
| `user` | `ObjectId` | required |

Use the `timestamps: true` option so that the `createdAt` property can be used to display the date & time of each note.

## Implement the Following MVP User Stories

- AAV, I want to see an auth page to sign-up or log in so that I can create notes.

- AAU, I want to see a `[Log Out]` link/button to return to the auth page.

- AAU, I want to see a "No Notes Yet!" message if I have yet to enter any.

- AAU, I want to see a listing of all of **my** previously entered notes including the text and date & time (`createdAt` property) for each note.

    > Use the `toLocaleString()` method to better format the date/time.

    > This app is user-centric, only the notes for the logged in user should be displayed.

- AAU, I want to see an `<input>` or `<textarea>` and an `[Add Note]` button above the listing of notes that I can use to enter a new note.

- AAU, when I click the `[Add Note]` button to add a new note, I want to see it appear in the list of existing notes.

## Bonus User Stories

- AAU, I want to be able to toggle the display of the notes between ascending & descending date (`createdAt`).

- AAU, I want to be able to delete a note.

## Super Bonus User Story

- AAU, I want to be able to edit a note.
