# MERN-Stack Infrastructure Log In Lab

## Setup

This lab continues to build-out the `mern-infrastructure` project right where the _MERN-Stack Infrastructure - Part 6_ lesson left off.

Move into your **~/code** folder:
```
cd ~/code
```
Open the project in VS Code:
```
code .
```

### Start the Express Backend

Open an integrated Terminal in VS code (`control + backtick`).

Start the Express server:
```
nodemon server
```

### Start the React Development Server

Open a second integrated Terminal in VS code (`control + backtick`).

Start the React Development server:
```
npm start
```

## Intro

Please complete this lab prior to completing the MERN-Stack Infrastructure - Part 7 lesson.

Also, this lab provides an awesome opportunity to collaborate with classmates!

### Implementing Logging In Functionality

Logging in is very much like signing up!

First things first though, let's get the tedious stuff out of the way...

### Create the `<LoginForm>` Component

Productive developers always look to copy/paste work they've already written if it makes sense to do so.

‚ùì Is there a component that makes sense to copy/paste as the starting point for <code>&LT;LoginForm></code>?
</summary>
<hr>

**The `<SignUpForm>` is a good candidate, but we would probably want to refactor it into a function component.**

<hr>
</details>

There's some good news and some bad news - which do you want first?

<details>
<summary>
The Good News...
</summary>
<hr>

**The `<LoginForm>` is below and ready to use!**

```jsx
// src/components/LoginForm/LoginForm.jsx

import { useState } from 'react';
import * as usersService from '../../utilities/users-service';

export default function LoginForm({ setUser }) {
  const [credentials, setCredentials] = useState({
    email: '',
    password: ''
  });
  const [error, setError] = useState('');

  function handleChange(evt) {
    setCredentials({ ...credentials, [evt.target.name]: evt.target.value });
    setError('');
  }

  async function handleSubmit(evt) {
    // Prevent form from being submitted to the server
    evt.preventDefault();
    try {
      // The promise returned by the signUp service method 
      // will resolve to the user object included in the
      // payload of the JSON Web Token (JWT)
      const user = await usersService.login(credentials);
      setUser(user);
    } catch {
      setError('Log In Failed - Try Again');
    }
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <div className="form-container">
        <form autoComplete="off" onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
          <label>Email</label>
          <input type="text" name="email" value={credentials.email} onChange={handleChange} required />
          <label>Password</label>
          <input type="password" name="password" value={credentials.password} onChange={handleChange} required />
          <button type="submit">LOG IN</button>
        </form>
      </div>
      <p className="error-message">&nbsp;{error}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

<details>
<summary>
Now for the Bad News...
</summary>
<hr>

**Just kidding - this is great news!**

**You've had considerable practice working with state, input, props, etc., so you're going to implement the rest of the login functionality by following the steps below!**

<hr>
</details>

#### Be sure to review all of the following steps before starting to code...

1. Add the `<LoginForm>` component above to the project following the naming convention for the folder and module.

2. Render the `<LoginForm>` below the `<SignUpForm>` in `<AuthPage>`. Later we will add a bit of UI state to and a button to use to display only one of the forms at a time.

3. Start implementing login functionality by reading the code in the `handleSubmit` function in **LoginForm.jsx** - the call to `usersService.login(credentials)` starts your journey.

    > üëÄ IMPORTANT:  The existing code in **LoginForm.jsx** is complete - don't change anything!

4. Again, follow the flow from the UI to the server and back.

5. Use the code and logic we used to implement Sign Up functionality as a guide. The `login` functions that need to be added to the **users-service.js** and **users-api.js** modules are similar to the existing `signUp` functions.

6. FYI, the solution code uses the server-side route of `POST /api/users/login` mapped to a controller action named `login`.

7. The `login` controller action is perhaps the most challenging part of this lab. Although in structure it's similar to `create`, it has slightly different functionality - instead of creating the user we need to query for the user based upon their `email` and then verify the password is correct using [bcrypt's `compare` method](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt#with-promises).

    > Hint 1: The `User` model's `findOne` is the appropriate query method to use to find a user based on their email.

    > Hint 2: Remember to require the bcrypt library.
    
    > Hint 3: When invoking bcrypt's `compare` method, use the syntax that returns a promise and consume it with `await`.

      <details>

      Peek if you must...
      </summary>
      <hr>

      ```js
      const match = await bcrypt.compare(req.body.password, user.password);
      ```

      <hr>
      </details>

    > Hint 4: Be sure to structure the code so that it responds with a status code of 400 if either the user is not found in the database (bad email) or if the user is found but the password doesn't match.

    <details>
    <summary>
    Feel free to use the following code if you get stuck!
    </summary>
    <hr>

    ```js
    // controllers/api/users.js

    // Be Sure to add the following
    const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');

    module.exports = {
      create,
      login
    };

    async function login(req, res) {
      try {
        const user = await User.findOne({ email: req.body.email });
        if (!user) throw new Error();
        const match = await bcrypt.compare(req.body.password, user.password);
        if (!match) throw new Error();
        res.json( createJWT(user) );
      } catch {
        res.status(400).json('Bad Credentials');
      }
    }
    ```

    <hr>
    </details>

8. See how far you can get and feel free to reach out for assistance if you get stuck - enjoy!

9. Instead of showing both the `<SignUpForm>` and `<LoginForm>` simultaneously, implement showing one or the other in `<AuthPage>` - just like the [deployed SEI CAFE](https://sei-cafe.herokuapp.com/) does.

    > Hint: This is an obvious use case for a piece of ui-related state.

#### Congrats - hope you found this lab fun and challenging!

We'll be wrapping up the `mern-infrastructure` project coming up in Part 7!
