### 8. ðŸ’ª Practice Exercise: Define and Render Another Component (10 mins)

Your turn to create and render another component:

- Refactor "React To-Do" so that the `<ToDoList>` component renders two `<ToDoListItem>` components instead of the two `<li>` components.
- Define the `<ToDoListItem>` component in its own JS module using the proper naming convention.
- Simply have the `<ToDoListItem>` component render `<li>To Do Item</li>`. In the next lesson you will learn how to render data passed to the component.
- Submit the link to your sandbox in the Assignment Submission's input box.

This is what you will see when finished:
