## 8. Using State to Handle Multiple Inputs

We've seen how to handle a single input within a form, but often we'll need to use several inputs for gathering all of the data we need.

Now let's put in a rep that demonstrates how to use a single state variable to hold any number of values for any number of inputs - this will also help you with the lab.

### Set Up the New Form

Create a new sandbox then copy and paste this into **App.js**:

```jsx
import "./styles.css";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <form>
        <label>NAME</label>
        <input name="name" />
        <label>EMOTION</label>
        <select name="emotion">
          <option value="üòÅ">Happy</option>
          <option value="üòê">Neutral</option>
          <option value="üò†">Angry</option>
        </select>
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}
```

We are only using a `<form>` as a "container" for the inputs - there isn't even a submit button.

Sure, there's only two inputs in this example, but the approach we're going to use applies to any number of inputs.

Here's just a bit of CSS to add to **App.css**:

```css
form {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: auto auto;
  gap: 0.5rem;
  width: 20rem;
  text-align: left;
  font-size: 1.5rem;
}
```

### Do We Really Need a State Variable For Each Input?

Imagine that we had a form with a dozen or more inputs.  Based on what you've seen thus far you might think that you would need to have a dozen or more state variables with their own setter functions, etc.

Having dedicated state for each input is not only verbose, it's also not convenient when having to send that data to a server.

Instead, as we learned in the lesson about state, a single state variable can be anything, including an object and that's our ticket:

```js
export default function App() {
  const [formData, setFormData] = useState({
    name: "",
    emotion: "üòÅ"
  });
  ...
```

It's no coincidence that the name of the properties on the `formData` object match the values assigned to the `name` props on the inputs. Doing so allows for the following concise `onChange` handler that will update the state for any number of inputs.

### Add the `onChange` Handler Function

Here's the only handler function we need:

```js
export default function App() {
  const [formData, setFormData] = useState({
    name: "",
    emotion: "üòÅ"
  });

  function handleChange(evt) {
    // Replace with new object and use a computed property
    // to update the correct property
    const newFormData = { ...formData, [evt.target.name]: evt.target.value };
    setFormData(newFormData);
  }
  ...
```

> üëÄ [Computed property names](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Object_initializer#Computed_property_names) allow for a JS expression to dynamically determine the key of the property.

Similar to how we used the spread operator with arrays, we're using it here to first spread all of the existing properties within a new object literal.

Then, any additional properties are comma separated and are either added to the object, or used to updated existing properties.

### Bind the Handler to the `onChange` Event

Each input needs to have an `onChange` prop added so that the handler is invoked:

```html
<input name="name" onChange={handleChange} />
...
<select name="emotion" onChange={handleChange}>
```

That's all it takes!

We could use React Developer Tools to verify it's working, but let's add an `<h1>` to display the results instead:

```html
...
</form>
<h1>{formData.name} is {formData.emotion}</h1>
```

## 9. The Keys to Programming in React

Now that you've worked a bit with the fundamentals of React, let's look a few **key** thoughts every React developer considers when developing a React application - whether they know it or not:

1. **We code components to render (visualize) application-state**, for example, render a `<ToDoListItem>` component for each to-do in the `todos` application-state array.
2. **We can code components to render other components based upon UI-state**, for example, hide/show a component based upon `showDetails` UI-state, disable a button based upon `isValid`, etc.
3. **In response to user-interaction, we apply any necessary program logic and/or calculations and ultimately update all impacted state causing the components to re-render.**

## 10. Final Version of the Fundamentals of React Chart

Here is the completed [Fundamentals of React Chart](https://gist.github.com/jim-clark/cbc87fdf01c22f412737ca121ef70761) that is excellent to review from time-to-time, make flash cards from, or read before bedtime üòÉ

The following has been added from this lesson...

| React Fundamental | Summary |
|---|---|
| .... | .... |
| Event Handling | Instead of using `addEventListener`, in React we connect event handlers (functions) to events using event props on React Elements.<br><br>Examples of event props are: `onClick`, `onChange`, `onSubmit`, etc. |
| Handling Input | [Controlled Inputs](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#controlled-components) are the React way to gather input from the user with `<input>`, `<select>` or `<textarea>` React Elements.<br><br>A controlled input must include both `value` & `onChange` props.<br><br>Forms are optional in a SPA but they can be beneficial for validation & CSS layout/formatting. If forms are used, be sure to prevent them from being submitted to the server by calling `preventDefault()` on the event object from within the `onSubmit` event handler. |
