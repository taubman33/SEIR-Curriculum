### 8. ðŸ’ª Practice Exercise: Define and Render Another Component (10 mins)

Your turn to create and render another component:

- Refactor "React To-Do" so that the `<ToDoList>` component renders two `<ToDoListItem>` components instead of the two `<li>` components.
- Define the `<ToDoListItem>` component in its own JS module using the proper naming convention.
- Simply have the `<ToDoListItem>` component render `<li>To Do Item</li>`. In the next lesson you will learn how to render data passed to the component.
- Submit the link to your sandbox in the Assignment Submission's input box.

This is what you will see when finished:

## 9. Install and Open React Developer Tools 

You may have noticed that CodeSandbox has a **React DevTools** tab used to troubleshoot components.

We definitely want to be able to do the same in Chrome!

Browse to the [React Developer Tools extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi) and install it.

Now when DevTools are open, you'll find a **Components** option available on the far right (you may have to click the `>>` to see it):

Clicking it reveals an amazing tool for browsing the component hierarchy and inspecting the details of a component's state and props (yet to be discussed).
