## 2. Attaching Event Handlers Using Event Props

### Browser Events in React

As a reminder, there are [hundreds of different browser events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events).

<details>

</details>

Like many things in React, event handling is a little different than what we are used to.

Let's see how...

### Connecting Handler Code to Events in React

In React, we do not add event listeners using JavaScript's `addEventListener` method.

Instead, we assign event handling functions to "event" props, e.g., `onClick`, on React Elements (`<div>`, `<p>`, etc.).

React supports any browser event you will ever need as documented by [this list of supported events](https://reactjs.org/docs/events.html#supported-events)

Let's start by adding a `<button>` to hide/show the to-dos when clicked:

```jsx
return (
  <div className="App">
    <h1>React To-Do</h1>
    {/* Add  button below */}
    <button>{showTodos ? 'HIDE' : 'SHOW'}</button>
    ...
```

> üëÄ Any React Element that results in a visible HTML element can respond to click events, not just buttons.

Now we can use the `onClick` prop to attach an event handler, **which must be a function (this is important)**:

```html
<button onClick={alert}>{showTodos ? 'HIDE' : 'SHOW'}</button>
```

We're just passing the built-in `alert` function as a baby step.  When the button is clicked, React's event system will invoke the provided function, passing to it an event object.

Our goal is to toggle the boolean `showTodos` state value by assigning a function to the `onClick` prop that will ultimately call the `setShowTodos` setter function.

Since we don't have any significant logic to perform, we should be able to call the existing `setShowTodos` setter function inline with the `onClick` prop instead of having to write a separate function like this:

```html
<button onClick={setShowTodos(!showTodos)}>{showTodos ? 'HIDE' : 'SHOW'}</button>
```

However, due to something important mentioned earlier, the above approach won't work.

<details>
<summary>
‚ùì Why won't the following approach work?
</summary>
<hr>

We need to provide a function, not invoke a function.

<hr>
</details>

### Passing Arguments to Event Handlers

So, what's the solution if we need to pass arguments to an event handler function?

Check this out:

```html
<button onClick={() => setShowTodos(!showTodos)}>{showTodos ? 'HIDE' : 'SHOW'}</button>
```

As you can see, the fix is to wrap the call to `setShowTodos` with a function - thanks to their conciseness, arrow functions are great for this purpose!

Toggle those to-dos!

### Event Handling Summary

- The names of event props are camelCased (`onClick`). In HTML, the attribute would be `onclick`. Here's the [list of events](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/events.html#supported-events) supported by React.

- The JS expression (always within curly braces) assigned to an event prop must evaluate to a **function**. A function type, **not** a function call (unless that function call returns a function).

- React automatically implements event delegation and makes event handling more efficient in a React app by managing events internally - check out React's [Synthetic Event Object](https://reactjs.org/docs/events.html) to learn more.

## 3. Using "Controlled Inputs" in React

### Adding New To-Dos

To add new to-dos, we could just add additional code to the `<App>` component.

However, a better approach would be to create a separate component responsible for inputting a new to-do...

### üëâ You Do - Create a new `<NewToDoForm>` Component (5 minutes)

1. Create a `<NewToDoForm>` component in its own module (named according to best practices).

2. `<NewToDoForm>` should just render an `<h2>New To-Do</h2>` for now.

3. In **App.js** below the `<ToDoList>` component, render an `<hr />` followed by the `<NewToDoForm>` component like this:

  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/lHw9V7D.png">

### Forms in React Are Not Required

Forms are not required to wrap input elements in SPAs because we always send data to the server using [AJAX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)), not by submitting a form.

In fact, we need to prevent forms from being submitted to the server because it will cause the page to reload which SPAs avoid.

However, we often still use forms in React for validation, layout/styling using CSS frameworks, etc.

We'll begin by adding a to-do without using a form. Then, we'll add a form later to perform validation and learn how to prevent the form from being submitted to the server which would trigger a page reload.

### Controlled Components (`<input>`)

In a typical HTML page, input elements such as `<input>`, `<textarea>` and `<select>`, maintain their own internal state.

However, handling input the "React way" is different...

  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/YcDo3iJ.png">

1. The value of an input, i.e., what is displayed, is maintained by state defined in the component.

2. The state is bound to the input's `value` prop resulting in the input displaying the value of the state.

3. An event handler function assigned to the `onChange` prop is used to updating the state's value.

The above approach is what React refers to as a [controlled component/input](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#controlled-components).

### Adding a Controlled `<input>`

Let's add the following JSX to **NewToDoForm.jsx**:

```jsx
export default function NewToDoForm() {
  return (
    <>
      <h2>New To-Do</h2>
      <input placeholder="New To-Do" />
      <button>ADD TO-DO</button>
    </>
  );
}
```

> üëÄ Reminder: React Elements have props such as `placeholder` that provide the functionality of their HTML attribute equivalents.

Now let's make it a controlled input by first adding state for the `<input>` as mentioned in bullet point number `1.` above.

### üëâ You Do - Add `newTodo` State (2 minutes)

1. Use the `useState` hook to add state named `newTodo`.

    > Hint: Don't forget to import `useState`

2. Initialize `newTodo` to an empty string.

3. You know what to name the setter - right?

### The Key to Controlled Inputs:  `value` & `onChange` Props 

As we saw above, all controlled inputs must include the following two props:

- `value`: This prop is used to bind the state to the input's value (what is displayed).

- `onChange`: This event prop will call the provided callback function whenever the user types in the input. Within the callback, we need to update the state variable bound to `value`.

### Bind State to the `value` Prop

Let's start by binding the newly added `newToDo` state to the `value` prop of the `<input>` in **NewToDoForm.jsx**:

```html
<input value={newTodo} placeholder="New To-Do" />
```

Easy peasy - to check it out, try initializing the state to something other than empty string.

### Handling the `onChange` Event

You just saw how the `<input>` displays the value of the state it is bound to using the `value` prop.

However, try typing in the input - nothing happens because we need to update the state as the user types.

Here's a way to update the state using the setter function and without having to define another function:

```jsx
export default function NewToDoForm() {
  const [newTodo, setNewTodo] = useState("");
  return (
    <>
      <h2>New To-Do</h2>
      <input
        value={newTodo}
        onChange={(evt) => setNewTodo(evt.target.value)}
        placeholder="New To-Do" />
      <button>ADD TO-DO</button>
    </>
  );
}
```

When React invokes the event handler function, it passes in an event object as an argument for which we defined a parameter, `evt`.

Then, just like in vanilla JS, the event object can be used to access the input's internal value via `evt.target.value`.

</details>

## 4. Adding the New To-Do

Now that we have the `<input>` working and know how to respond to events in React, we can add new to-dos by:

- Adding an `onClick` handler to the [ADD TO-DO] button.

- When the button is clicked, add the new to-do using the `setTodos` setter function.

- Clearing the input for a better user experience (UX).

### Adding the `onClick` Handler to the [ADD TO-DO] Button

We're not going to be able to perform all of the required logic inline this time, instead let's write an additional function within **NewToDoForm.jsx**:

```jsx
export default function NewToDoForm() {
  const [newTodo, setNewTodo] = useState("");

  // Add this new handler
  function handleAddTodo() {
    alert(newTodo);
  }

  ...
```

We're alerting the `newTodo` state value as a baby step.

Now let's attach the new handler by adding an `onClick` prop to the button:

```html
<button onClick={handleAddTodo}>ADD TO-DO</button>
```

<details>
<summary>
‚ùì Why didn't we have to wrap <code>handleAddTodo</code> with an arrow function in this case?
</summary>
<hr>

We don't need to provide any arguments to <code>handleAddTodo</code> when invoking it, thus we can simply provide the function itself.

<hr>
</details>

### Updating the `todos` State

Let's answer the following questions...

<details>
<summary>
‚ùì Which component "owns" the <code>todos</code> State?
</summary>
<hr>

<code>&lt;App&gt;</code>

<hr>
</details>

<details>
<summary>
‚ùì Which component "owns" the setter function used to update the <code>todos</code> State?
</summary>
<hr>

<code>&lt;App&gt;</code>

<hr>
</details>

<details>
<summary>
‚ùì Does the <code>&LT;NewToDoForm></code> have access to the <code>setTodos</code> setter function?
</summary>
<hr>

No

<hr>
</details>

So, we could solve this dilemma by passing a reference to `setTodos` as a prop.  However, we also would need to pass a reference to the `todos` state as well to use with the spread operator.

We certainly could pass those props without much hassle, however, it just doesn't feel right - instead, it makes more sense to update state within the component that owns that state, in this case, `<App>`.

So let's add a new function within **App.js** that we can then pass to `<NewToDoForm>` as a prop:

```js
const [showTodos, setShowTodos] = useState(true);

// Add this function
function addTodo(todo) {
  // Replace state, don't mutate it
  setTodos([...todos, todo]);
}
```

As discussed in the last lesson, we are using the spread syntax to include (spread) the current elements of the `todos` array within a new array literal, adding the new todo at the end.

### üëâ You Do - Pass `addTodo` to the `<NewToDoForm>` Component (2 minutes)

1. Pass the `addTodo` function from **App.js** to the `<NewToDoForm>` component using a prop with the same name.

2. Update `<NewToDoForm>` to destructure the `addTodo` prop being passed to it.

<hr />

Now we're ready to add the to-do by updating the `handleAddTodo` function in **NewToDoForm.jsx**:

```js
function handleAddTodo() {
  // alert(newTodo);
  addTodo(newTodo);
}
```

Try it out!

Now let's improve the UX...

### üëâ You Do - Reset the `<input>` Back to an Empty String (1 minute)

- Improve the UX by adding a single line of code inside of the `handleAddTodo` function that clears out the value displayed in the `<input>`.

  > Hint:  Controlled inputs get their displayed value from state!

## 5. Using `<form>` React Elements

Now that we've shown that using a `<form>` in React is optional, let's refactor "React To-Do" to use a `<form>` so that we can learn how to prevent them from being submitted to the server, etc.

### Add the `<form>` React Element

Let's start by refactoring to use a `<form>`:

```html
<form onSubmit={handleAddTodo}>
  <input
    value={newTodo}
    onChange={(evt) => setNewTodo(evt.target.value)}
    placeholder="To-Do"
  />
  <button type="submit">ADD TO-DO</button>
</form>
```

> üëÄ Forms in React will never have an `action` or `method` prop/attribute because they are never submitted to a server!

Note that we've:

- Removed the `onClick` from the button and changed its type to `type="submit"`

- Added the `onSubmit` event prop to the form - this is the typical approach when working with forms.

With the above refactor, a new to-do will only appear for a second before the form triggers a refresh when the submit button is clicked...

## 6. Preventing a `<form>` From Being Submitted

To prevent a form from being submitted, we need to invoke the `preventDefault()` method on the event object.

First we need to add a parameter to the `handleAddTodo` function to accept the event object that React passes automatically:

```js
//
function handleAddTodo(evt) {
  ...
```

Next, we invoke the `preventDefault()` method first thing:

```js
function handleAddTodo(evt) {
  evt.preventDefault();
  addTodo(newTodo);
  setNewTodo("");
}
```

Now there's no more page reload when adding a new to-do!

## 7. Validating Data In a `<form>`

Because all of the data for a form's inputs will be held in state, it's possible to validate that state every time it changes using code in the handler; setting additional state, e.g, `isValid`, accordingly.

However, we can easily take advantage of the form's HTML5 validation capabilities to ensure that data has been entered as desired.

As we saw in the lesson on Regular Expressions, we can add a `required` and `pattern` attribute to HTML inputs to validate their data. React works with these props as well!

For example, let's prevent empty to-dos from being created:

```html
<input
  value={newTodo}
  onChange={(evt) => setNewTodo(evt.target.value)}
  placeholder="To-Do"
  required
  pattern=".{4,}"
/>
```

Now, thanks to built-in HTML5 validation, the form cannot be submitted unless at least 4 characters are entered!

We've only scratched the surface of validation built-into browsers.  You can begin to learn more by reading about the comprehensive [constraint validation Web API here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Constraint_validation).
