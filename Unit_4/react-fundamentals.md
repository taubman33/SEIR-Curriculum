# Fundamentals of React

| React Fundamental | Summary |
|---|---|
| [React](https://reactjs.org/) | <ul><li>A JS library for building dynamic UIs using components.</li></ul> |
| [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) | <ul><li>A syntax extension to JS that looks like HTML and makes defining UIs more intuitive vs. pure JS.</li><li>JSX emits text in the page when a JS expression is surrounded with curly braces<br><code>&LT;div>{/* JS Expression */}&LT;/div></code>.</li><li>JSX transpiles into a function call that returns a JS object, thus, JSX can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to functions, etc.</li><li>JSX can render an array of components, however, each component needs a `key` prop with a unique value.<br><code>const catList = cats.map(c => &LT;div key={cat.id}>{cat.name}&LT;/div>);</code>.</li></ul> |
| Components  | <ul><li>A user interface is defined by a hierarchy of components.</li></ul>|
| User-Defined Component | <ul><li>May be defined as a function or class but must be named using UpperCamelCasing.</li><li>May hold and manage application state.</li><li>May contain or utilize application logic such as fetching data, implementing the win/loss logic of a game, etc.</li></ul> |
| React Elements | <ul><li>React's built-in components, such as `<div>`, that render their corresponding HTML element into the DOM.</li><li>Are always named using lowercase.</li></ul> |
| When a Component's State is Updated | <ul><li>The component is re-rendered.</li><li>All children components are also rendered, and so on until there are no more components to render.</li></ul> |
| Props | <ul><li>Props are used to pass information (any JS expression) to a child component.</li><li>Function Components are passed a `props` object as an argument.</li><li>Props should never be updated - consider them immutable.</li><li>React Elements can be passed props that correspond to HTML attributes, e.g., `id`, `placeholder`, `pattern`, etc.  However, some are named or used slightly differently.</ul> |
| State | <ul><li>When a component's state is updated, the component re-renders.</li><li>Most state is data-related, i.e., related to the purpose of the application. However, a component can use UI-related state to control the dynamic rendering of its UI.</li><li>The `useState` hook is used to manage state in a Function Component.</li><li>Invoking `useState(<initial value of the state>)` returns an array whose first element is the state's current value and whose second element is a setter function used to update the state's value.</li><li>Only data that you want to cause a re-render when it changes should be defined as state.</li></ul> |
| Styling | <ul><li>Only React Elements such as <code>&LT;div></code>, <code>&LT;form></code>, etc. can be styled because user-defined components aren't rendered to the DOM.</li><li>The `className` prop is used to assign classes and may be a JS expression resulting in a string of class name(s).</li><li>The `style` prop is used when styling needs to be computed each time the component renders and must be assigned a JS object with keys representing the camelCased names of CSS properties.</li></ul> |
| Event Handling | <ul><li>Instead of using `addEventListener`, in React we connect event handlers (functions) to events using event props on React Elements.</li><li>Examples of event props are: `onClick`, `onChange`, `onSubmit`, etc.</li></ul> |
| Handling Input | <ul><li>[Controlled Inputs](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#controlled-components) are the React way to gather input from the user with `<input>`, `<select>` or `<textarea>` React Elements.</li><li>A controlled input must include both `value` & `onChange` props.</li><li>Forms are optional in a SPA but they can be beneficial for validation & CSS layout/formatting. If forms are used, be sure to prevent them from being submitted to the server by calling `preventDefault()` on the event object from within the `onSubmit` event handler.</li></ul> |
  | **The Keys to Programming in React** | <ul><li>**We code components to render (visualize) application-state**, for example, render a `<ToDoListItem>` component for each to-do in the `todos` application-state array.</li><li>**We can code components to render other components based upon UI-state**, for example, hide/show a component based upon `showDetails` UI-state, disable a button based upon `isValid`, etc.</li><li>**In response to user-interaction, we apply any necessary program logic and/or calculations and ultimately update all impacted state causing the components to re-render.**</li></ul> |
