### Contribution Review Process

The Learning Team reviews contributions weekly.

For bugs, typos, broken links, or lessons and lab contributions (particularly for updates in technology), the Team LED will likely approve your PR immediately.

For more complex suggestions, A team member may reach out for more information, and a more lengthy review process may ensue.

We regret that we cannot incorporate contributions that do not align with the official syllabus available on General Assembly’s website. Contributions that would extend the course beyond this official scope will be considered but cannot be incorporated without approval from the General Assembly Legal and Regulatory team. For this reason, larger scale suggestions and change requests generally require a longer runway in order to consider and act on.
