# Express - Update To-Do (Challenge Exercises)

### Learning Objectives

| Students Will Be Able To: |
|---|
| Use `method-override` Middleware and HTML Forms to Update on the Server |
| Prefill Inputs with Existing Data |

## Road Map

1. Setup
2. Intro
3. Exercise #1 - Updating the Text of the To-Do
4. Exercise #2 - Changing Whether the To-Do is Done or Not 

## 1. Setup

This lesson continues to build upon the `express-todos` project.

1. Move into the repo/project folder:
    ```
    cd ~/code/express-todos
    ```
2. Open project in VS Code:
    ```
    code .
    ```
3. Open an Integrated Terminal (`control + backtick`) and start the Express server:
    ```
    nodemon
    ```
4. **If the app is not running** or if you just want to make sure you are starting with the same code as your instructor, **sync your project** using the following command:
    ```
    git reset --hard origin/sync-7-update-starter
    ```

5. Ensure that all of the dependencies are installed:
    ```
    npm i
    ```

## 2. Intro

This lesson is a bonus/challenge exercise!

Although I will be coding the functionality in the video, if you're feeling up to it, consider relying on the provided hints and writing the code on your own.

Updating a To-Do is very similar to creating one because it also is a two-request process:

1. One request to display a form used to edit the To-Do (`edit` functionality).
2. Another request to update the To-Do on the server (`update` functionality).

## 3. Exercise #1 - Updating the Text of the To-Do

### Hints:

- Follow the same 5-steps in the [Guide to Add a Feature to a Web App](https://gist.github.com/jim-clark/9f9bd19d60d9ce2ec57be8242b6aee96) we've now followed several times.
- Be sure to reference the [Routing Chart](https://gist.github.com/jim-clark/17908763db7bd3c403e6) to determine the proper routes!
- Your users will expect to have the data they want to edit prefilled in the form's inputs. Use EJS squids to assign the current value of the todo to the input's `value` attribute. Don't forget the double-quotes though outside of the squids.
- In order to pull off the above hint, the controller action will first have to get the To-Do being edited (using the `Todo` model's `getOne` method) and provide it to the view.

## 4. Exercise #2 - Changing Whether the To-Do is Done or Not 

### Hints:

- Use an `<input type="checkbox" ...>`
- Checkboxes are checked when a `checked` attribute exists (no value is assigned).
- Use squids and a ternary expression to emit into the input a `checked` attribute, or an empty string.
- If the checkbox is checked when submitted, `req.body.done` will have the value of `"on"`, otherwise there won't even be a `req.body.done` property thanks to the crazy way HTML checkboxes were designed to work back in the day.

##### Have fun and enjoy the challenge!
