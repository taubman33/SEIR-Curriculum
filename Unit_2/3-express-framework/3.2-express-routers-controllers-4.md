## 7. üí™ Routing Quiz (10 min)

üëÄ **Refer to the [RESTful Routes to CRUD Mapping Guide](https://gist.github.com/jim-clark/17908763db7bd3c403e6) as necessary**

### All questions assume a data resource of `cats`

(1) What will the name of the router module be? (include its parent directory)

(2) Write the line of code within **server.js** that would require the above router and assign it to a variable named `catsRouter`.

(3) Write the line of code within **server.js** that would mount the above router object prefixing the proper path of `/cats`.

**For the following questions, assume a cats controller assigned to a variable named `catsCtrl` within `routes/cats.js` - write the following code within `routes/cats.js`**:

(4) Write the line of code that defines the proper route that would read/display all cats (cats **index** route).

(5) Write the line of code that defines the proper route that would read/display a single cat (cats **show** route).

(6) Write the line of code that defines the proper route that would display a view that includes a form for submitting a new cat (cats **new** route).

(7) Write the line of code that defines the proper route that would handle the cat form being submitted and creates a new cat in the database (cats **create** route).

## 8. MVC Organization Revisited

Notice how we now have the following for the **todos data resource**:

- **models/todo.js**
- **views/todos** (directory)
- **controllers/todos.js**
- **routes/todos.js**

> Again, everything is named plurally except the model.

Each data _resource_ should receive the same treatment. For example, if you had a **cats** data resource, another set of the above modules would be created and dedicated to CRUDing cats.

## 9. URL/Route Parameters

In our web apps, we will often need to pass information, such as an identifier for a certain data resource, in the **path** of the HTTP request.

**URL Parameters**, also known as **Route Parameters**, just like parameters in functions, provide a way for data to be passed in to the router & controller via the URL of the request.

Let's look at this analogy...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/X8Cj85b.png">

In Express, we define route parameters in the path string using a colon, followed by the parameter name.

Let's say we want to view a details page for a resource.  Just like how we use an **index** route/action to list all of a resource, we will use a **show** route/action when displaying the details of a single resource.

Let's add the functionality to view a single To-Do...

## 10. Adding Show To-Do Functionality

When adding functionality to your apps, start by identifying what route makes sense - this is usually based on the [RESTful Routes to CRUD Mapping](https://gist.github.com/jim-clark/17908763db7bd3c403e6) you referred to while taking the quiz.

### Identify the Proper Route

According to REST, the "proper" route to display a single To-Do would be:

```
GET /todos/:id
```

With the proper route identified, the next step is to create some UI that will send a request that matches that route!

### Update the View to Add a Link

Let's refactor **todos/index.ejs** as follows:

```html
<% todos.forEach(function(t) { %>
  <li>
    <a href="/todos/<%= t.id %>"><%= t.todo %></a>
```

Refresh the page and hover over the links. Looking at the bottom-left of the window will verify the paths look correct!

<details>
<summary>
‚ùì Links always send an HTTP request using what HTTP method?
</summary>
<hr>

<code>GET</code>

<hr>
</details>

The UI is set to send the proper HTTP requests to the server.

However, clicking one of those links will display a<br>_Not Found 404_<br>error - this means that there is no route on the server that matches the HTTP request.

Let's add one...

### Define the Route

Add the **show** route below the **index** route as follows:

```js
// GET /todos
router.get('/', todosCtrl.index);
// GET /todos/:id
router.get('/:id', todosCtrl.show);
```

Saving will crash the app because there is no `todosCtrl.show` method being exported from the controller...

### Code and Export the `show` Controller Action

Add the `show` action inside of **controllers/todos.js** and don't forget to export it!

```js
function show(req, res) {
  res.render('todos/show', {
    todo: Todo.getOne(req.params.id),
  });
}
```

> **KEY POINT:**  Express's `req.params` object will have a property for each **route parameter** defined, for example...

For example, a route defined like this:

```js
router.get('/category/:catName/page/:pageNo', ...);
```
and a link like this:

```html
<a href="/category/socks/page/2">Next Page</a>
```
would have a `req.params` available in the controller of:

```js
console.log(req.params.catName) //=> "socks"
console.log(req.params.pageNo) //=> "2"
```

> Note that all route param values are strings.

Another refresh informs us that the `show` action in the controller is calling a `Todo.getOne` method that doesn't exist.

### Add the `getOne` Method to the `Todo` Model

Let's fix that error! In **models/todo.js**:

```js
module.exports = {
  getAll,
  getOne
};

function getOne(id) {
  // URL params are strings - convert to a number
  id = parseInt(id);
  // The Array.prototype.find iterator method is
  // ideal for finding objects within an array
  return todos.find(todo => todo.id === id);
}
```	

Refresh and of course there's an error because we haven't created the  **views/todos/show.ejs** that we're trying to render.

### Code the `show.ejs` View

Touch the **views/todos/show.ejs**.

Copy the markup from **views/todos/index.ejs** and then add this:

```html
<body>
  <h3><%= todo.todo %></h3>
  <h3>Complete: <%= todo.done ? 'Yes' : 'No' %></h3>
</body>
```

Refresh - üëè

### Congrats!

Note: When searching for info on the Express framework, be sure that you search for the info for version 4 only - there were significant changes made from earlier versions. Also note that version 5 is currently in beta although all of the code we've written should be compatible.
