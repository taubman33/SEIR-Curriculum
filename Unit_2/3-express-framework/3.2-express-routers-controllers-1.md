## 1. Setup

To get ready for this lesson, simply `cd ~/code`.

## 2. Express Generator

Okay, so we've had big fun getting an Express app up and running from scratch.

We defined some basic routes and rendered a couple of views using the EJS view engine.

The first thing we'll take a look at in this lesson is a popular tool: `express-generator`.

`express-generator` creates a "skeleton" Express app that:

- Separates the HTTP server code from our web app's logic.
- Has best practice routing implemented.
- Has key middleware configured and mounted by default.
- Is configured to serve static assets from a `public` folder.
- Will configure the EJS view engine (if we specify the `-e` option)
- Has error handling configured.

### Install `express-generator`

We install `express-generator` globally using NPM:

```
npm install -g express-generator
```

`express-generator` is a CLI that can be run from anywhere, that's why we install it using the global `-g` flag.

### If `express-generator` Won't Install or Run

If your system won't install or run express-generator, it can be used with `npx` instead as described below.

### Available Options

Let's take a look at the options available to us

```
express -h

  Usage: express [options] [dir]

  Options:

        --version        output the version number
    -e, --ejs            add ejs engine support
        --pug            add pug engine support
        --hbs            add handlebars engine support
    -H, --hogan          add hogan.js engine support
    -v, --view <engine>  add view <engine> support (dust|ejs|hbs|hjs|jade|pug|twig|vash) (defaults to jade)
        --no-view        use static html instead of view engine
    -c, --css <engine>   add stylesheet <engine> support (less|stylus|compass|sass) (defaults to plain css)
        --git            add .gitignore
    -f, --force          force on non-empty directory
    -h, --help           output usage information
``` 

If `express-generator` did not install or if the above `express` command did not work, use `npx` instead as follows:

```
npx express-generator -h
```

> Note that we need to use the full package name, `express-generator`, when running with npx.

### Specify the View Engine

We'll definitely want to use the EJS view engine each time we scaffold a new Express project.

The help above identifies the following option flags to make EJS the view engine:

- `-e`
- `-ejs`
- `--view=ejs`
- `-v=ejs`

All of the above option flags do the exact same thing, kind of like the shortest one 😀

### Scaffold Our `express-todos` App

Let's learn more about Express by building a simple To-Do app.

We scaffold an app using the `express` command:

```
express -e express-todos
```

> Note that when a name is specified, `express-generator` creates a folder with that name and creates the app within it.  If you are already in an existing folder, you can run `express -e .` to scaffold the app within that folder.

Again, if `express-generator` did not install or if the above `express` command did not work, use `npx` instead as follows:

```
npx express-generator -e express-todos
```

We now need to `cd` into the new folder and open in our text editor:

```
cd express-todos
code .
```

### Install the Node Modules

Express generator has created a `package.json` that lists the necessary Node modules, however, those modules are not installed.

Let's open a terminal session (`option` + `backtick`) and install them:

```
npm i
```

### Folder Structure

Let's briefly review the scaffolded contents in VS Code:

```
├── app.js
├── bin
│   └── www
├── package.json
├── public
│   ├── images
│   ├── javascripts
│   └── stylesheets
│       └── style.css
├── routes
│   ├── index.js
│   └── users.js
└── views
    ├── error.js
    └── index.js
```

### Renaming `app.js` to `server.js`

MERN/MEAN Stack apps often have a client-side file named `app.js` and this could get confusing having two `app.js` files, thus many developers name their main Express file `server.js`.

So let's rename it:

1. Rename `app.js` to `server.js`.

2. Inside of `bin/www`, we need to update line 7 to require `server` instead of `app`:

	```js
	var app = require('../app');
	```
		
	to:
		
	```js
	var app = require('../server');
	```

### Starting the Application

One option to start the server is to type `npm start`. This will execute the start script specified in *package.json*. However, it doesn't restart the app when there's changes...

`nodemon` is still our best option and we can now just type `nodemon` which will use that same `start` script.

Browsing to `localhost:3000` greets us with:

## 2. MVC Code Organization

MVC (Model-View-Controller) has been a proven approach for organizing code for decades where the:

- **Model**:  Is the data concern
- **View**:  Is the presentation concern
- **Controller**:  Is the "processing" concern that processes the HTTP requests coming from the browser, CRUDs (Creates/Reads/Updates/Deletes) data using models, and ultimately responds to the browser's request by rendering views and returning the resulting HTML or by issuing a redirect. 

### MVC in Express

Express, as it states on its landing page, is _unopinionated_.  This means we are free to structure and organize our Express apps anyway we please.

In fact, many web frameworks such as Ruby on Rails, ASP.net, Spring MVC (Java), and others implement the MVC architectural pattern.

Accordingly, most Express developers use MVC to organize their Express applications as well...

### Adding a `models` & `controllers` Folder

Express generator has already organized the view templates into a `views` folder. 

So we just need to make folders to hold our model and controller modules:

```
mkdir models controllers
```

With the `models`, `views` and `controllers` folders set up, we're ready to discuss best practice routing...

## 4. Best Practice Routing

In our `first-express` app, we used the `app.get` method to define routes and although it worked, the better practice is to:

- Use Express `router` objects to define routes for a particular purpose or dedicated to a certain data resource such as `todos`.
- Create each `router` in its own module from which it is exported.
- Inside of **server.js** `require` and mount the `router` object in the request pipeline.

> Note:  A **data resource** is a "type" of data/information that applications create, read, update and/or delete (CRUD).

### Best Practice Routing Set Up by Express Generator

As an example of using this better approach to routing, let's look at how `express-generator` sets up routing...

First, there's a `routes` folder containing two router modules:

- **index.js**: Great for defining general purpose routes, e.g., the root route.
- **users.js**: An example of a router dedicated to a _data resource_, in this case, _users_. 

Note how routes are defined on those two `router` objects using `router.get()` method call just like we did previously with `app.get()`

Each `router` object has one route defined - compare those two routes, notice the **HTTP methods** and the **paths**?  They're the same - isn't that a problem?  Nope, they're not actually the same because of the way the routers are mounted in **server.js**...

### Router Objects in the Scaffolded App

The two route modules are required on lines 7 & 8 of `server.js`.

Then those routers are mounted in the middleware pipeline with the `app.use` method on lines 22 & 23:

```js
app.use('/', indexRouter);
app.use('/users', usersRouter);
```

> **IMPORTANT KEY POINT:** The path specified in `app.use` is a **"starts with path"**. It is **prepended** to the paths specified in the router object forming the **actual path**.

### Determining the Actual Path of a Route Defined in a Router Object

Let's say you have a `router` object that defines a route like this:

```js
// routes/todos.js

var express = require('express');
var router = express.Router();

router.get('/', function(req, res) {...
```
	
and is mounted like this:
	
```js
const todosRouter = require('./routes/todos');

// All routes defined in todosRouter will start with /todos
app.use('/todos', todosRouter);
```

<details>
<summary>
❓ What is the actual path of the route?
</summary>
<hr>

The starts with path is <code>/todos</code> and the path of the defined route is just <code>/</code> which doesn't change the actual path, thus the actual path is <code>/todos</code>

<hr>
</details>

Another example, let's say you have a `router` object that defines a route like this:

```js
// routes/calendar.js

var express = require('express');
var router = express.Router();

router.get('/today', function(req, res) {...
```
	
and is mounted like this:
	
```js
const calendarRouter = require('./routes/calendar');

app.use('/calendar', calendarRouter);
```

<details>
<summary>
❓ What is the actual path of the above route?
</summary>
<hr>

The starts with path is <code>/calendar</code> and the path of the defined route is <code>/today</code> making the actual path <code>/calendar/today</code>

<hr>
</details>
