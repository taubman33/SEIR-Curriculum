3. Our First Middleware
4. Creating To-Dos
5. `method-override` Middleware
6. Delete a To-Do
7. Further Study

## 1. Setup

This lesson continues to build upon the `express-todos` project.

1. Move into the repo/project folder:
    ```
    cd ~/code/express-todos
    ```
2. Open project in VS Code:
    ```
    code .
    ```
3. Open an Integrated Terminal (`control + backtick`) and start the Express server:
    ```
    nodemon
    ```
4. **If the app is not running** or if you just want to make sure you are starting with the same code as your instructor, **sync your project** using the following command:
    ```
    git reset --hard origin/sync-2-middleware-starter
    ```

## 2. What is Middleware?

In the Intro to Express lesson, we identified the three fundamental capabilities provided by web application frameworks:

1. The ability to define routes
2. The ability to process HTTP requests using middleware
3. The ability to use a view engine to render dynamic templates

We've already defined routes and rendered dynamic templates.

In this lesson we complete the trifecta by processing requests using middleware.

### Middleware are Functions

A middleware is simply a function with the following signature:

```js
function(req, res, next) {
  // "Process" the request, etc.
  
  // End by calling next()
  next()
}
```

You're already familiar with Express's [request object](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html#req) (`req`) and [response object](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html#res) (`res`) objects.

Because they are just objects, middleware may modify them in anyway they see fit.

The `next` parameter is a function provided by Express used to pass control to the next middleware in the pipeline, or alternatively, "raise" an error (a lesson for another day).

### Mounting Middleware

Express' [app.use()](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html#app.use) method is used to mount middleware into its **middleware pipeline**.

It's called a **pipeline** because the HTTP request flows through it.

### Purpose of Middleware

Middleware can be used to perform functionality such authentication and processing the request in multitude of ways.

Let's review the purpose of each middleware mounted in our Express generated app:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/MjyrF1d.png">

### Controller Functions (Route Handlers) Are Middleware

Yes, you have already written middleware - the controller actions, `todosCtrl.index` & `todosCtrl.show`, are technically middleware!
	
The controller middleware functions didn't need to define the `next` parameter because they were at the **end of the middleware pipeline**.  That is, they ended the request/response cycle by calling a method on the `res` object, e.g., `res.render()`.

## 3. Our First Middleware

There's no better way to understand middleware than to see one in action.

Open **server.js** and add this "do nothing" middleware:

```js
app.set('view engine', 'ejs');
	
// add middleware below the above line of code
app.use(function(req, res, next) {
  console.log('Hello SEI!');
  next();  // Pass the request to the next middleware
});
```

Type `nodemon` to start the server, browse to `localhost:3000`, and check terminal.

Let's add a line of code that modifies the `req` object by adding the current time to Express's request object that then can be accessed by any subsequent middleware: 

```js
app.use(function(req, res, next) {
  console.log('Hello SEI!');
  // Add a time property to the res.locals object
  // The time property will then be accessible when rendering a view
  res.locals.time = new Date().toLocaleTimeString();
  next();
});
```
> The [res.locals object](http://expressjs.com/en/api.html#res.locals) can be used to provide data to a view rendered during that request.  In fact, the object provided as the second arg to `res.render()` is merged with `res.locals`. 

Now we can render the `time` property in **todos/index.ejs** by updating the `<h1>` as follows:

```html
<h3>To-Dos as of <%= time %></h3>
```
Refresh!

### The Order That Middleware is Mounted Matters

We call it the **middleware pipeline** for a reason - the request flows through the middleware in the order they are mounted using `app.use`.

In **server.js**, let's move our custom middleware below where the routers are being mounted:

```js
app.use('/', indexRouter);
app.use('/todos', todosRouter);
	
app.use(function(req, res, next) {
  console.log('Hello SEI!');
  res.locals.time = new Date().toLocaleTimeString();
  next();
});
```

Refresh shows that it no longer works because the router middleware are ending the request/response cycle before our "first middleware" is reached.

Move it back above the routes - yep, order of middleware matters.

## 4. Creating To-Dos

Time to add some additional functionality to our app - adding To-Dos!

What exact functionality do we want?

Do we want to show a form on the `index` view, or do we want a separate page dedicated to adding a To Do?

Typically, for adding To-Dos, you'd want have the form on the same page, however, today we'll demo the dedicated page approach so that we can see how **creating data is often a two-request task**:

1. Browser sends an initial request to see a page that includes a form to input the data, and...

2. The second request will happen when the form is submitted to the server so that it may create the new data, in this case a To-Do, and respond to the client with a "redirect" (status code 302), i.e., tell the browser to make a new GET request.

So yes, creating and updating data in a multi-page web application is often a two-request process:

- `new` + `create` to create a resource
- `edit` + `update` to update a resource

### Suggested Workflow to Add Functionality to a Web App

In SEI, we don't just teach the syntax of programming - we teach helpful processes and techniques, e.g., the Guide on How to Build a Browser Game, that are difficult to discover on your own.

So, you want to add a new feature to your web app?

Below summarizes the goals described by the [Guide to Add a Feature to a Web App](https://gist.github.com/jim-clark/9f9bd19d60d9ce2ec57be8242b6aee96):

1. Identify the "proper" Route (HTTP Method + Path)

2. Create the UI (`<a>` or `<form>`) that will send an HTTP request that matches that route.

3. Define the route on the server and map it to a controller action.

4. Code and export the controller action.

5. `res.render()` a view in the case of a `GET` request, or `res.redirect` if data was changed.  Write the view template if it does not already exist.

Okay, since we are going for the two-request approach, let's get started implementing the `new` functionality that shows a page with a form to enter a new To-Do...

#### Step 1 - Identify the "proper" Route

Checking the [Resourceful Routing for CRUD Operations in Web Applications Chart](https://gist.github.com/jim-clark/17908763db7bd3c403e6), we find that the proper route is:

```
GET /todos/new
```

Let's document this proper route by adding a comment within **routes/todos.js**:

```js
// GET /todos
router.get('/', todosCtrl.index);
// GET /todos/:id
router.get('/:id', todosCtrl.show);
// GET /todos/new   <-- this new route cannot not stay here!
```

#### Step 2 - Create the UI that issues the request

Next step is to add a link in **views/todos/index.ejs** that will invoke this route:

```html
...
  </ul>
  <a href="/todos/new">Add To-Do</a>
```

#### Step 3 - Define the route on the server

Add the `new` route in **routes/todos.js** as follows:

```js
// GET /todos
router.get('/', todosCtrl.index);
// GET /todos/new
router.get('/new', todosCtrl.new);
// GET /todos/:id
router.get('/:id', todosCtrl.show);
```

<details>
<summary>
‚ùì Why does the <code>new</code> route need to be defined before the <code>show</code> route?
</summary>
<hr>

Express attempts to match routes to the request in the order that they are defined.

If `new` was defined after the `show` route, then the text of "new" in the URL of the request, e.g.,
```
https://localhost:3000/todos/new
```
would match the `:id` route parameter defined in the "show" route causing the `todosCtrl.show` function to run instead of the intended `todosCtrl.new` function.

<hr>
</details>

#### Step 4 - Code and export the controller action

We need to code the `todosCtrl.new` action we just mapped to the `new` route...

In **controllers/todos.js**:

```js
module.exports = {
  index,
  show,
  new: newTodo
};
	
function newTodo(req, res) {
  res.render('todos/new', { title: 'New Todo' });
}
```

> Note that you cannot name a function using a JS [reserved word](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Lexical_grammar#reserved_words), however, there's no problem with object properties. 

#### Step 5 - Render the view & write it if necessary

We already called `res.render()`, we just need to write the **new.ejs** template.

Create **views/todos/new.ejs**, then copy this good stuff:

```html
<%- include('../partials/header') %>

<form action="/todos" method="POST" autocomplete="off">
  <input type="text" name="todo">
  <button type="submit">Save Todo</button>
</form>

<%- include('../partials/footer') %>
```

Just a basic HTML form is being used to send data to the server when the form is submitted.

When the form is submitted, its `method` and `action` attributes determine what method and path the HTTP request will have:

- The `method` attribute holds the HTTP method/verb. It will usually be set to "POST", but may be a "GET" when performing searches.
- The `action` attribute holds the path.  We'll see why we set `action="/todos"` in a bit.

> Note: The `autocomplete="off"` attribute will prevent the often annoying autocomplete feature of inputs.

Verify that clicking the **Add To-Do** link displays the page with the form - bravo!

### Implementing the second-request (`create`) functionality

Again, creating data can take two separate requests - it depends upon the design of the app.

Let's get started implementing that second-request responsible for creating the new To-Do on the backend...

#### Step 1 - Identify the "proper" Route

**üëâ You Do - Identify the Proper Route <small>(1 min)</small>**

1. Use the [Routing Chart](https://gist.github.com/jim-clark/17908763db7bd3c403e6") to identify the proper route (HTTP Method & Endpoint) for creating a To-Do data resource on the server.

2. Comment the proper route as we've been doing within **routes/todos.js** 

#### Step 2 - Create the UI that issues the request

The `<form>` we already completed **is** the UI and it's ready for business!

> Check [this](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Forms/Your_first_HTML_form) out if you want to learn more about HTML Forms.

‚úÖ Step 1 - Determine proper route

‚úÖ Step 2 - Create UI

#### Step 3 - Define the Route

In **routes/todos.js**:

```js
router.get('/:id', todosCtrl.show);
// POST /todos
router.post('/', todosCtrl.create);  // add this route
```

Yay - our first non-`GET` route!

#### Step 4 - Code and export the controller action

In **controllers/todos.js**:

```js
  ...
  create
};
	
function create(req, res) {
  console.log(req.body);
  // The model is responsible for creating data
  // Todo.create(req.body);
  // Do a redirect anytime data is changed
  res.redirect('/todos');
}
```

Check out what properties on the `req.body` object get logged out.

`req.body` is courtesy of this middleware in **server.js**:
	
```js
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: false }));
```

The properties on `req.body` will always match the values of the `<input>`'s `name` attributes:

```html
<input type="text" name="todo">
```

Okay, let's uncomment `Todo.create(req.body);` and go code it!

We need is that `create` in **models/todo.js**:

```js
// models/todo.js

module.exports = {
  getAll,
  getOne,
  create
};
	
function create(todo) {
  // Add the id
  todo.id = Date.now() % 1000000;
  // New todos wouldn't be done :)
  todo.done = false;
  todos.push(todo);
}
```

> Note that whenever `nodemon` restarts the server, additional To-Dos will be lost because we are not using a database to save them - yet!

#### Congrats on creating To-Dos!

## 5. `method-override`  Middleware

<details>
<summary>
‚ùì Once again - Using HTML's <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> elements, the browser can only send HTTP requests that have _____ or _____ HTTP methods?
</summary>
<hr>

**`GET` or `POST`**

<hr>
</details>

However, the [Resourceful Routing for CRUD Operations in Web Applications Chart](https://gist.github.com/jim-clark/17908763db7bd3c403e6) shows that performing full-CRUD data operations requires `DELETE` & `PUT` requests also.

If we were using JavaScript (AJAX), we wouldn't have a problem, but we're not - so what do we do if we want to delete or update a To-Do?

[method-override](https://www.npmjs.com/package/method-override) middleware to the rescue!

The `method-override` middleware allows the request to be sent as a `POST` from the browser, but be changed on the server to a `DELETE`, `PUT`, etc.

Because `method-override` is not built into Express, we need to install it in Terminal:

```
npm i method-override
```

Require it below `logger` in **server.js**:

```js
var logger = require('morgan');
var methodOverride = require('method-override');
```

Now let's add `method-override` to the middleware pipeline:

```js
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));
app.use(methodOverride('_method'));  // add this
```

> We are using the [Query String](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string) approach for `method-override` as documented [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/method-override#override-using-a-query-value).

## 6. Delete a To-Do

With `method-override` ready to go, let's add the functionality to delete To-Dos!

The user story reads:<br>**_As a User, I want to delete a To Do from the list_**

Here we go again following the same process explained in the [Guide to Add a Feature to a Web App](https://gist.github.com/jim-clark/9f9bd19d60d9ce2ec57be8242b6aee96)...

#### Step 1. Determine the proper route

We already identified the proper route when we coded the `<form>`.

Cool, on to step 2...

#### Step 2 - Create the UI

By default, `method-override` only listens for `POST` requests, therefore we use a `<form>` to send requests that need to be treated as `PUT` or `DELETE` on the server.

Therefore, we'll use a `<form>` for the UI in **views/todos/index.ejs**:

```html
<% todos.forEach(function(t) { %>
  <li>
    <form action="/todos/<%= t.id %>?_method=DELETE"
      class="delete-form" method="POST">
      <button type="submit">X</button>
    </form>
```

The `?_method=DELETE` is the query string that `method-override` looks for.  If it finds it, it changes the HTTP method to whatever is specified - always us all caps, e.g., `DELETE`.

How about a little styling in **public/stylesheets/style.css** to make the delete form look better:

```css
.delete-form {
  display: inline-block;
  margin-right: 10px;
}
	
.delete-form button {
  color: red;
}
	
li {
  list-style: none;
}
```

Refresh and use DevTools to ensure the links look correct.

#### Step 3 - Define the route on the server

I bet you could have done this one on your own!

In **routes/todos.js**:

```js
router.post('/', todosCtrl.create);
// new route below
router.delete('/:id', todosCtrl.delete);
```

#### Step 4 - Code and export the controller action - next...

Similar to `newTodo`, we can't name a function `delete`, so...

```js
  create,
  delete: deleteTodo
};
	
function deleteTodo(req, res) {
  Todo.deleteOne(req.params.id);
  res.redirect('/todos');
}
```

Again, according to the MVC architectural pattern, it's the Todo model's responsibility to perform the delete.

#### Add the `deleteOne` method to the `Todo` model

All that's left is to add the `deleteOne` method to the `Todo` model:

```js
module.exports = {
  getAll,
  getOne,
  create,
  deleteOne
};
	
function deleteOne(id) {
  // All properties attached to req.params are strings!
  id = parseInt(id);
  // Find the index based on the id of the todo object
  const idx = todos.findIndex(todo => todo.id === id);
  todos.splice(idx, 1);
}
```
> Using the Array.prototype.filter method is another option for removing the todo.

Does it work?  Of course it does!

In the next lesson, we'll see how to update a To-Do!

## 7. Further Study

The following summarizes the name of purpose of the CRUD actions...

| CRUD Action | Purpose |
|---|---|
| index | Display all of a data resource |
| new<br>+<br>create | Display a form to add a new data resource<br>+<br>Handle the form being submitted and create the data resource |
| show | Display a single data resource |
| delete | Delete a single data resource |
| edit<br>+<br>update | Display a form to edit an existing data resource<br>+<br>Handle the form being submitted and update the data resource |

When searching for info on the Express framework, be sure that the results are for version 4 - there were significant changes made from earlier versions.
