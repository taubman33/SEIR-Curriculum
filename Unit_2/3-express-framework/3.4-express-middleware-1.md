# Express Middleware

### Learning Objectives

| Students Will Be Able To: |
|---|
| Describe the Use Case of Middleware |
| Use `urlencoded` Middleware and HTML Forms to Create Data on the Server |
| Use `method-override` Middleware and HTML Forms to Delete Data on the Server |
| Use Query Strings to Provide Additional Information to the Server |

## Road Map

1. Setup
2. What is Middleware?
3. Our First Middleware
4. Creating To-Dos
5. `method-override` Middleware
6. Delete a To-Do
7. Further Study

## 1. Setup

This lesson continues to build upon the `express-todos` project.

1. Move into the repo/project folder:
    ```
    cd ~/code/express-todos
    ```
2. Open project in VS Code:
    ```
    code .
    ```
3. Open an Integrated Terminal (`control + backtick`) and start the Express server:
    ```
    nodemon
    ```
4. **If the app is not running** or if you just want to make sure you are starting with the same code as your instructor, **sync your project** using the following command:
    ```
    git reset --hard origin/sync-2-middleware-starter
    ```

## 2. What is Middleware?

In the Intro to Express lesson, we identified the three fundamental capabilities provided by web application frameworks:

1. The ability to define routes
2. The ability to process HTTP requests using middleware
3. The ability to use a view engine to render dynamic templates

We've already defined routes and rendered dynamic templates.

In this lesson we complete the trifecta by processing requests using middleware.

### Middleware are Functions

A middleware is simply a function with the following signature:

```js
function(req, res, next) {
  // "Process" the request, etc.
  
  // End by calling next()
  next()
}
```

You're already familiar with Express's [request object](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html#req) (`req`) and [response object](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html#res) (`res`) objects.

Because they are just objects, middleware may modify them in anyway they see fit.

The `next` parameter is a function provided by Express used to pass control to the next middleware in the pipeline, or alternatively, "raise" an error (a lesson for another day).

### Mounting Middleware

Express' [app.use()](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html#app.use) method is used to mount middleware into its **middleware pipeline**.

It's called a **pipeline** because the HTTP request flows through it.

### Purpose of Middleware

Middleware can be used to perform functionality such authentication and processing the request in multitude of ways.

Let's review the purpose of each middleware mounted in our Express generated app:

### Controller Functions (Route Handlers) Are Middleware

Yes, you have already written middleware - the controller actions, `todosCtrl.index` & `todosCtrl.show`, are technically middleware!
	
The controller middleware functions didn't need to define the `next` parameter because they were at the **end of the middleware pipeline**.  That is, they ended the request/response cycle by calling a method on the `res` object, e.g., `res.render()`.

## 3. Our First Middleware

There's no better way to understand middleware than to see one in action.

Open **server.js** and add this "do nothing" middleware:

```js
app.set('view engine', 'ejs');
	
// add middleware below the above line of code
app.use(function(req, res, next) {
  console.log('Hello SEI!');
  next();  // Pass the request to the next middleware
});
```

Type `nodemon` to start the server, browse to `localhost:3000`, and check terminal.

Let's add a line of code that modifies the `req` object by adding the current time to Express's request object that then can be accessed by any subsequent middleware: 

```js
app.use(function(req, res, next) {
  console.log('Hello SEI!');
  // Add a time property to the res.locals object
  // The time property will then be accessible when rendering a view
  res.locals.time = new Date().toLocaleTimeString();
  next();
});
```
> The [res.locals object](http://expressjs.com/en/api.html#res.locals) can be used to provide data to a view rendered during that request.  In fact, the object provided as the second arg to `res.render()` is merged with `res.locals`. 

Now we can render the `time` property in **todos/index.ejs** by updating the `<h1>` as follows:

```html
<h3>To-Dos as of <%= time %></h3>
```
Refresh!

### The Order That Middleware is Mounted Matters

We call it the **middleware pipeline** for a reason - the request flows through the middleware in the order they are mounted using `app.use`.

In **server.js**, let's move our custom middleware below where the routers are being mounted:

```js
app.use('/', indexRouter);
app.use('/todos', todosRouter);
	
app.use(function(req, res, next) {
  console.log('Hello SEI!');
  res.locals.time = new Date().toLocaleTimeString();
  next();
});
```

Refresh shows that it no longer works because the router middleware are ending the request/response cycle before our "first middleware" is reached.

Move it back above the routes - yep, order of middleware matters.
