## 5. `method-override`  Middleware

‚ùì Once again - Using HTML's <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> elements, the browser can only send HTTP requests that have _____ or _____ HTTP methods?

However, the [Resourceful Routing for CRUD Operations in Web Applications Chart](https://gist.github.com/jim-clark/17908763db7bd3c403e6) shows that performing full-CRUD data operations requires `DELETE` & `PUT` requests also.

If we were using JavaScript (AJAX), we wouldn't have a problem, but we're not - so what do we do if we want to delete or update a To-Do?

[method-override](https://www.npmjs.com/package/method-override) middleware to the rescue!

The `method-override` middleware allows the request to be sent as a `POST` from the browser, but be changed on the server to a `DELETE`, `PUT`, etc.

Because `method-override` is not built into Express, we need to install it in Terminal:

```
npm i method-override
```

Require it below `logger` in **server.js**:

```js
var logger = require('morgan');
var methodOverride = require('method-override');
```

Now let's add `method-override` to the middleware pipeline:

```js
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));
app.use(methodOverride('_method'));  // add this
```

> We are using the [Query String](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string) approach for `method-override` as documented [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/method-override#override-using-a-query-value).

## 6. Delete a To-Do

With `method-override` ready to go, let's add the functionality to delete To-Dos!

The user story reads:<br>**_As a User, I want to delete a To Do from the list_**

Here we go again following the same process explained in the [Guide to Add a Feature to a Web App](https://gist.github.com/jim-clark/9f9bd19d60d9ce2ec57be8242b6aee96)...

#### Step 1. Determine the proper route

We already identified the proper route when we coded the `<form>`.

Cool, on to step 2...

#### Step 2 - Create the UI

By default, `method-override` only listens for `POST` requests, therefore we use a `<form>` to send requests that need to be treated as `PUT` or `DELETE` on the server.

Therefore, we'll use a `<form>` for the UI in **views/todos/index.ejs**:

```html
<% todos.forEach(function(t) { %>
  <li>
    <form action="/todos/<%= t.id %>?_method=DELETE"
      class="delete-form" method="POST">
      <button type="submit">X</button>
    </form>
```

The `?_method=DELETE` is the query string that `method-override` looks for.  If it finds it, it changes the HTTP method to whatever is specified - always us all caps, e.g., `DELETE`.

How about a little styling in **public/stylesheets/style.css** to make the delete form look better:

```css
.delete-form {
  display: inline-block;
  margin-right: 10px;
}
	
.delete-form button {
  color: red;
}
	
li {
  list-style: none;
}
```

Refresh and use DevTools to ensure the links look correct.

#### Step 3 - Define the route on the server

I bet you could have done this one on your own!

In **routes/todos.js**:

```js
router.post('/', todosCtrl.create);
// new route below
router.delete('/:id', todosCtrl.delete);
```

#### Step 4 - Code and export the controller action - next...

Similar to `newTodo`, we can't name a function `delete`, so...

```js
  create,
  delete: deleteTodo
};
	
function deleteTodo(req, res) {
  Todo.deleteOne(req.params.id);
  res.redirect('/todos');
}
```

Again, according to the MVC architectural pattern, it's the Todo model's responsibility to perform the delete.

#### Add the `deleteOne` method to the `Todo` model

All that's left is to add the `deleteOne` method to the `Todo` model:

```js
module.exports = {
  getAll,
  getOne,
  create,
  deleteOne
};
	
function deleteOne(id) {
  // All properties attached to req.params are strings!
  id = parseInt(id);
  // Find the index based on the id of the todo object
  const idx = todos.findIndex(todo => todo.id === id);
  todos.splice(idx, 1);
}
```
> Using the Array.prototype.filter method is another option for removing the todo.

Does it work?  Of course it does!

In the next lesson, we'll see how to update a To-Do!

## 7. Further Study

The following summarizes the name of purpose of the CRUD actions...

| CRUD Action | Purpose |
|---|---|
| index | Display all of a data resource |
| new<br>+<br>create | Display a form to add a new data resource<br>+<br>Handle the form being submitted and create the data resource |
| show | Display a single data resource |
| delete | Delete a single data resource |
| edit<br>+<br>update | Display a form to edit an existing data resource<br>+<br>Handle the form being submitted and update the data resource |

When searching for info on the Express framework, be sure that the results are for version 4 - there were significant changes made from earlier versions.
