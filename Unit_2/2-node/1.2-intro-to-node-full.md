## 1. Setup

We'll be writing a bit of code in VS Code in this lesson!

1. In Terminal, move into your code folder:  `cd ~/code`
2. Make a new folder named first-node:  `mkdir first-node`
3. Move into the new folder:  `cd first-node`
4. Create a main.js file: `touch main.js`
5. Open the project/folder in VS Code:  `code .`

## 2. What is Node.js?

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/nXTOu8F.jpg">

**Node.js is a runtime environment that runs on the v8 javascript runtime for executing JavaScript outside of the browser!**

Node's runtime environment for JS is different than that in the browser, primarily because:
- It doesn't have the browser's DOM or [Web APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API).
- Node has low-level networking and file system APIs that browser JS does not (for security reasons).

Node is very "lightweight", i.e., only low-level "core" modules for networking, filesystem access, etc. are built-in.

However, its functionality is extended via open source libraries called packages.  These packages are managed using the `npm` command installed with Node.

Node's package ecosystem is the largest open source ecosystem in the world.

Other Facts:

- Created in 2009 by Ryan Dahl with Joyent, Inc.
- Uses the same _V8 JavaScript Engine_ used in the Chrome browser to compile JS programs into machine code.
- In addition to being used to build high-performance web applications, Node is also a great tool for building command-line tools.
- Node is an open source project governed by the [OpenJSFoundation/Node.js Foundation](https://foundation.nodejs.org/) with board representation from companies such as:

### Node's REPL

**REPL** is an acronym for Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop.

Programming languages such as Python and Ruby also have REPLs.

Let's first open an integrated Terminal in VS Code using `control + backtick`

To start [Node's interactive REPL](https://nodejs.org/api/repl.html) we type `node` in Terminal

In the REPL we can write JS and even load Node modules, which we're going to learn about in this lesson:

```
> 10 + 5
15
> function sayHello() {
... console.log('Hello');
... }
undefined
> sayHello()
Hello
undefined
> const http = require('http');
undefined
> http
[ a large JS object representing Node's 'http' module ]
```

Press `control-c` twice to exit REPL.

### Executing Node Programs

Executing a Node app is as easy as typing `node` in Terminal followed by the name of the module.  For example, if you have a module named **main.js**:

```
node main.js
```
Note that you don't need to include the ".js" file extension.
	
Yes, running a Node app is that easy!

### ‚ùì Review Questions - What is Node.js?

<details>
<summary>
(1) Is Node.js a programming language?
</summary>
<hr>

**No.** It is a **runtime environment** for executing JavaScript outside of the browser.

<hr>
</details>

<details>
<summary>
(2) Is <code>const el = document.getElementById('my-list');</code> a valid JavaScript statement in a Node app?
</summary>
<hr>

**No** because there is no DOM in Node.

<hr>
</details>

## 3. Why the Enthusiasm for Node.js?

First and foremost, **performance** - businesses can handle more traffic with less hardware!

Secondly, developer **synergy**. Developers can use JavaScript on both client & server, thus becoming a full-stack dev is more obtainable and companies can better utilize their developer resources across the front and back-ends.

The improvements in server performance and developer productivity result in **businesses saving money**.

Businesses saving money results in **wide adoption**:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/5nvUBa3.jpg">

Most importantly, wide adoption of Node.js results in strong demand for Node developers!

## 4. Why is Node.js so Performant?

It's important to understand how time consuming Input/Output operations are:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/iXshhYh.jpg">

Input/output is a term used to describe tasks a computer does that involves interfacing with external systems in the operating system or network. A basic example of an Input/Output workflow could be accessing data from a database, or making requests over a network, among many others. These processes typically take much more time than operations taking place inside of a runtime. Input/Output considerations are a massive concern for software engineers and not considering these in a reasonable manner can render your project unusable under certain situations and, at best, will introduce performance delays and capacity limits if not properly considered. One of the primary goals of Node.js was to assist engineers in alleviating some of these Input/Output challenges.

Node's **Asynchronous / Event-driven** design enables **non-blocking** Input/Output:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ARbweHg.jpg">

A typical Node server is capable of supporting _tens of thousands_ of concurrent connections!

Because Node's high-performance, non-blocking I/O operations must be designed as **asynchronous methods**, a Node developer will use callback functions and/or promises extensively.

Cool, let's learn about Node Modules...

## 5. Node Modules

Modules in Node allow us to **modularize** and **reuse** code in a Node app.

Modules can contain any number of JS functions and related data.

### Modules Built Into Node

Node itself comes with several _core modules_, such as the `http` and `fs` modules.

Let's use the core `fs` module to create a file:

```js
// main.js

const fs = require('fs');

fs.writeFile('./hello.txt', 'Hello!', function() {
  console.log('done creating file');
});
```

As we can see that the `fs` module "exports" an `object` that has methods such as `writeFile`.

### Our Own Node Modules

In a Node application, **every** JavaScript file is a module!

A Node app's modules (files) can be put in any folder within the project allowing us to create modules inside of aptly named folders, such as `models`, `routes`, `controllers`, `views`, etc.

A module is "loaded" into a Node app using Node's `require` function - just like we did to load the `fs` module. This `require` syntax is referred to as CJS(common javascript modules) and is the default in node.js. You may encounter alternative module loading syntaxes such as ESM(ECMAScript module syntax) when we begin working with react, but for right now, it's adequate just to understand that the use of `require` is typically associated with CJS module syntax.

Let's create a file/module named **days-of-week.js** by entering `touch days-of-week.js` in Terminal or by using VS Code's GUI.

Every Node module has a global `module` object - let's log it out and check out its properties:

```js
// days-of-week.js

console.log(module);
``` 

Now let's run our Node module by typing<br>`node days-of-week` in Terminal.

We're getting an inside look at how Node implements its module system:

```js
Module {
  id: '.',
  path: '/Users/username/code/first-node',
  exports: {},
  filename: '/Users/username/code/first-node/days-of-week.js',
  loaded: false,
  children: [],
  paths: [
    '/Users/username/code/first-node/node_modules',
    '/Users/username/code/node_modules',
    '/Users/username/node_modules',
    '/Users/node_modules',
    '/node_modules'
  ]
}
```

Each module is uniquely identified by its fully qualified filename (including the folder path). This allows modules to be named the same, as long as they exist in different folders.

The property on `module` that we're really interested in though is `exports`...

### `module.exports`

The `exports` property on the `module` variable is used to "export" whatever functionality should be exposed by the module...

### Exporting a Single Piece of Functionality

Whatever is assigned to `module.exports` can be accessed by any number of other modules using the `require` function we saw earlier.

Let's verify this by assigning a string to `module.exports`:

```js
// days-of-week.js

module.exports = 'SEI Rocks!';
```

Now in **main.js**, we can now put the `require` function to work:

```js
// main.js

const daysOfWeek = require('./days-of-week');
console.log(daysOfWeek);  // -> SEI Rocks!
```
Then type `node main` in Terminal to test it out!

It is convention to name the variable the same as, or similar to, the name of the module being required. 

When we require our app's own modules, we need to always provide a relative path, i.e., starting with either a `.` or `..`

<hr>

üëâ **You Do:** Update `module.exports` <small>(1 min)</small>

1. Instead of exporting a string, change **days-of-week.js** to export the following array instead:

	```js
	['Su', 'Mo', 'Tu', 'We', 'Th', 'Fr', 'Sa']
	```

2. Run `node main` again to check it out.

> Key Point:  `require()` returns whatever `module.exports` holds!

<hr>

If we updated 

```js
// main.js

const daysOfWeek = require('./days-of-week');
console.log(daysOfWeek);  // -> SEI Rocks!
```
to
```js
const daysOfWeek = require('./days-of-week')[1];
console.log(daysOfWeek);
```

<details>
<summary>
‚ùì What would be logged out?
</summary>
<hr>

**`Mo`**

<hr>
</details>

### Exporting Lot's of Functionality 

`module.exports` is initialized to an empty object by default allowing us to easily create properties on it.

Creating properties on `module.exports` is a way to expose multiple pieces of functionality.

Let's try it out:

```js	
// days-of-week.js

const weekdays = ['Su', 'Mo', 'Tu', 'We', 'Th', 'Fr', 'Sa'];

module.exports.weekdays = weekdays;

module.exports.getWeekday = function(dayNo) {
  if (dayNo < 0 || dayNo > 6) dayNo = 0;
  return weekdays[dayNo];
};
```

Now let's test it in **main.js**:

```js
const daysOfWeek = require('./days-of-week');

const day = daysOfWeek.getWeekday(5);
console.log(day);
```
`Fr` should be logged out.

> Key Point:  Again, `require()` returns whatever `module.exports` is assigned or holds!

Another common approach to exporting multiple pieces of functionality like above would be to assign a new object like this:

```js	
// days-of-week.js

const weekdays = ['Su', 'Mo', 'Tu', 'We', 'Th', 'Fr', 'Sa'];

module.exports = {
  weekdays,
  getWeekday
};

function getWeekday(dayNo) {
  if (dayNo < 0 || dayNo > 6) dayNo = 0;
  return weekdays[dayNo];
}
```

#### `exports` Shortcut Variable

- Node also provides a "shortcut" variable named `exports` that references that very same object that `module.exports` does.

- For example, could do this:

  ```js
  exports.weekdays = ['Su', 'Mo', 'Tu', 'We', 'Th', 'Fr', 'Sa'];
  ```
  instead of:
  ```js
  module.exports.weekdays = ['Su', 'Mo', 'Tu', 'We', 'Th', 'Fr', 'Sa'];
  ```

- **IMPORTANT:** It is not possible to _**assign**_ functionality to the `exports` shortcut variable because it will stop referencing `module.exports`.

#### Module Miscellaneous

- Since modules are about code reuse, they can be required an unlimited number of times throughout the application.

- The code in the module **only runs the first time the module is required**.<br>Allow me demo this for you.

- Any variables declared within a module are local to the module - they do not pollute the global scope.

- The global scope in a Node application is represented by an object named `global`, **unlike the browser's ________ object**.

## 6. Practice Exercises - Node Modules <small>(15 mins)</small>

### üí™ Modules Practice - Single Piece of Functionality

Create a module named `random.js`:

1. That has a function **assigned** to the `module.exports` object.
2. The function should define two parameters, `min` & `max`.
3. The function should return a random number, as an integer, between `min` & `max`, inclusive.  This code snippet should look a bit familiar:
    ```js
    Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1) + min);
    ```
4. Test the module in `main.js` like this:
	
	```js
	const random = require('./random');
	for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
	  console.log( random(100, 200) );
	}
	```

### üí™ Modules Practice - Multiple Functionality

Create a module named `circle.js`:

1. That exports two functions, both of which have a `radius` parameter defined.
2. The functions should be named `area` & `circumference`.
3. The functions should...
	- `area`: Computes the area of a circle (radius squared X Pi), with the radius provided as an argument. 
	- `circumference`: Computes the circumference of a circle (radius X 2 X Pi), with the radius provided as an argument
4. Hint: In JS we use `Math.PI` for Pi.
5. Test the module in `main.js` like this:

	```js
	const circle = require('./circle');
	console.log( circle.area(50) );  // 7853.98...
	console.log( circle.circumference(75) );  // 471.23...
	```

## Conclusion

In the next lesson, you will use one of the most popular Node modules, `Express`, that turns Node into a capable web server!

## 7. Further Study

### npm - Node Package Manager

Node uses a package management system to distribute open-source packages called [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (**N**ode **P**ackage **M**anager).

Usually a package distributes a Node module, however, sometimes the package distributes a CLI instead of a module we would use in our program.

Node programs use a `package.json` file that tracks the installed modules that the app depends upon.

Tracking an application's dependencies in `package.json` removes the necessity to push the app's node modules to the projects GitHub repo - this saves **MASSIVE** file storage and bandwidth.

If you start a Node app from scratch, the first thing you should do is create the `package.json` file by entering the following command:

```
npm init
```

It's okay to accept all of the default settings.  To accept the defaults without being prompted, you can run the command as follows:

```
npm init -y
```

Now, let's use `npm` to download and install a package:

```
npm install request
```

There is now a `node_modules` folder that contains a folder for the `request` module and its many dependencies.

There's also a new `package-lock.json` file that npm uses to track dependencies and unlike `package.json`, should not be edited.

Note: it's highly recommended that `node_modules` be added to your `.gitignore` file.

We can now require the `request` module in **main.js** and make HTTP requests:

```js
// Don't specify path when module is in node_modules
const request = require('request');
request(
  'http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users',
  function(err, res, body) {
    console.log(body);
  }
);
```
> Note the first parameter in the callback is `err`.<br>This "error-first" callback signature is prevalent throughout Node.

Type `node main` to try it out.

Examining the `packages.json` file reveals that it's structured something like this:

	```js
	{
	  "name": "first-node",
	  "version": "1.0.0",
	  "description": "",
	  "main": "main.js",
	  "scripts": {
	    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
	  },
	  "author": "User <email@user.com>",
	  "license": "MIT",
	  "dependencies": {
	    "request": "^2.88.0"
	  }
	}
	```

The `package.json` is used to install a project's dependencies.

Installing dependencies is necessary after cloning a repo or when using starter code for a lesson. 

To demonstrate this, first delete the `node_modules` file, then...

Now we can install our app's dependencies like this:

```
npm install
```

Witness the return of `node_modules`!
