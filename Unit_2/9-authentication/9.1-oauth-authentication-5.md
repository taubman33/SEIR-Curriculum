### Code the Next User Story

Our next user story reads:

> AAU, I want to be able to delete a review that I previously created.

We want to ensure that only the user that created a review can delete it.

As usual, we'll follow the 5 steps to add delete functionality...

#### Step 1 - Determine the Proper Route

<details>
<summary>
‚ùì What is the proper route to delete a review?
</summary>
<hr>

<code>DELETE /reviews/:id</code>

<p>Although Reviews are a nested resource, the server doesn't need to know the id of the movie that the review is embedded within; thus the "shallow route".</p>

<hr>
</details>

#### Step 2 - Display the UI to Send the HTTP Request

Nothing fancy...

Again, in **views/movies/show.ejs**:

```html
...
        <th>Rating</th>
        <!-- Add this placeholder header cell -->
        <th></th>
...
          <td><%= r.rating %></td>
          <!-- Add this td -->
          <td>
            <% if (user?._id.equals(r.user)) { %>
              <form action="/reviews/<%= r._id %>?_method=DELETE" method="POST">
                <button type="submit">X</button>
              </form>
            <% } %>
          </td>
```

The `user?._id...` is using JS's fresh [optional chaining operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Optional_chaining) (`?`) to avoid causing an error if `user` is not a an object (user not logged in).

The `_id.equals()` method is used to compare `_id`s - this is necessary because they are objects.

Lastly, looks like we need to install and mount `method-override` middleware:

```
npm i method-override
```

Require it:

```js
// server.js

var passport = require('passport');
// Add the line below 
var methodOverride = require('method-override');
```

Now let's mount it:

```js
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));
// Add the line below
app.use(methodOverride('_method'));
```

#### Step 3 - Define the Route

**üëâ You Do - Define the `delete` Route (1 min)**

Add the new route for deleting a review to **routes/reviews.js** router.

<details>
<summary>
Solution
</summary>
<hr>

<pre>
// DELETE /reviews
router.delete('/reviews/:id', reviewsCtrl.delete);
</pre>

<hr>
</details>

#### Step 4 - Code the `delete` Action

It's not enough to just hide the delete button when the review does not belong to the logged in user.

We should validate ownership in the controller action as well.  Again, using the [Guide to User-Centric CRUD using Express & Mongoose](https://gist.github.com/jim-clark/a714016bab26fad52106f6b2490e3eb7)...

```js
// controllers/reviews.js

module.exports = {
  create,
  // Add this export
  delete: deleteReview
};

async function deleteReview(req, res) {
  // Note the cool "dot" syntax to query on the property of a subdoc
  const movie = await Movie.findOne({ 'reviews._id': req.params.id, 'reviews.user': req.user._id });
  // Rogue user!
  if (!movie) return res.redirect('/movies');
  // Remove the review using the remove method available on Mongoose arrays
  movie.reviews.remove(req.params.id);
  // Save the updated movie doc
  await movie.save();
  // Redirect back to the movie's show view
  res.redirect(`/movies/${movie._id}`);
}
...
```

#### Step 5 - Render or Redirect

Already done in the above code!

Test it out!

Cool, just one step left!

## 8. Implement Authorization

<details>
<summary>
‚ùì What is <em>authorization</em>?
</summary>
<hr>

<strong>Authorization</strong> determines what functionality a given user can access.  For example, we don't want unauthenticated users to be able to delete reviews. 

<hr>
</details>

We've already coded some client-side authorization by:

- Conditionally displaying the `<form>` used to add reviews.
- Showing the delete button for only the reviews created by the logged in user.

We also performed a bit of server-side authorization by ensuring that the logged in user was the owner of the review being deleted.

In this step, we will see how we can easily protect the routes that require a user to be logged in, e.g., adding a movie or review.

Passport adds a nice method to the `req` object, `req.isAuthenticated()` that returns `true` or `false` depending upon whether there's a logged in user or not.

We're going to write our own little middleware function to take advantage of `req.isAuthenticated()` to perform some authorization.

### Code the Authorization Middleware

Since we want to protect routes defined in multiple modules, we'll want to stay DRY and code the middleware function in its own module.

```
touch config/ensureLoggedIn.js
```

We only want to export a single thing, a middleware function.  Thus, the best approach is to **assign** the function to `module.exports` as follows:

```js
// ensureLoggedIn.js

// Middleware for routes that require a logged in user
module.exports = function(req, res, next) {
  // Pass the req/res to the next middleware/route handler
  if ( req.isAuthenticated() ) return next();
  // Redirect to login if the user is not already logged in
  res.redirect('/auth/google');
}
```

Our custom `ensureLoggedIn` middleware function, like all middleware, will either call `next()`, or respond to the request.

### Using Authorization Middleware

Express's middleware and routing is extremely flexible and powerful.

We can add multiple middleware functions before a route's final middleware function!

Let's modify **routes/movies.js** to protect routes that require a logged in user using our new ensureLoggedIn middleware:

```js
// routes/movies.js

const moviesCtrl = require('../controllers/movies');
// Require the auth middleware
const ensureLoggedIn = require('../config/ensureLoggedIn');

router.get('/', moviesCtrl.index);
// Use ensureLoggedIn middleware to protect routes
router.get('/new', ensureLoggedIn, moviesCtrl.new);
router.get('/:id', moviesCtrl.show);
router.post('/', ensureLoggedIn, moviesCtrl.create);
```

Note the inserted `ensureLoggedIn` middleware function!

If the `ensureLoggedIn` middleware calls `next()`, then the next middleware, e.g., `moviesCtrl.new` will be called.

Test it out by logging out, and manually attempting to browse to `http://localhost:3000/movies/new`.  Very cool!

#### üëâ You Do - Protect More Routes (3 mins)

- Protect the **appropriate** routes in:
  - **routes/reviews.js**
  - **routes/performers.js**

#### üëç Congrats on implementing OAuth authentication and authorization!

Now you're ready to start your project and implement OAuth authentication before any other CRUD functionality.

## 9. üí™ Challenge Exercise (optional)

As an optional challenge exercise, use the [Guide to User-Centric CRUD using Express & Mongoose](https://gist.github.com/jim-clark/a714016bab26fad52106f6b2490e3eb7) to help you implement the following user story:

> AAU, I want to be able to update a review that I previously created.
