## 7. Code the User Stories

Our first user story reads:

> AAU, I want to add reviews for a movie when I'm logged in.

We already have a `<form>` for creating reviews on the **views/movies/show.ejs** template.

However, we **only** want this UI to show when there's a logged in user.

### ðŸ‘‰ You Do - Hide/Show Review `<form>` (2 minutes)

Using an `<% if %>` EJS block in **views/movies/show.ejs**, render the `<form>` for adding a review ONLY if there's a logged in user.

### Update the `reviewSchema`

We're going to make three changes to the `reviewSchema` to make it user-centric:

1. Add a `user` property that references the user's `ObjectId` that created the review.
2. To avoid having to populate review sub-docs just to display the user's name with them, we're also going to add a `userName` property.
3. Similar to `userName`, let's also add a `userAvatar` property.

Update `reviewSchema` in **models/movie.js**:

```js
const reviewSchema = new Schema({
  content: {
    type: String,
    required: true
  },
  rating: {
    type: Number,
    min: 1,
    max: 5,
    default: 5
  }
  // Don't forget to add the comma above then
  // add the 3 new properties below
  user: {
    type: Schema.Types.ObjectId,
    ref: 'User',
    required: true
  },
  userName: String,
  userAvatar: String
}, {
  timestamps: true
});
```

> Note that `required: true` has been added to prevent "orphan" reviews. You'll want to do the same on other user-centric schemas as well.

### Update the `create` action in the Reviews controller

Much of an application's CRUD data operations pertain to the logged in user.

The [Guide to User-Centric CRUD using Express & Mongoose](https://gist.github.com/jim-clark/a714016bab26fad52106f6b2490e3eb7) will prove very helpful when coding your projects.

We've already added the necessary properties to the `reviewSchmea`, now let's update the `create` action in the **controllers/reviews.js** controller:

```js
async function create(req, res) {
  const movie = await Movie.findById(req.params.id);

  // Add the user-centric info to req.body (the new review)
  req.body.user = req.user._id;
  req.body.userName = req.user.name;
  req.body.userAvatar = req.user.avatar;

  // We can push (or unshift) subdocs into Mongoose arrays
  movie.reviews.push(req.body);
  try {
    // Save any changes made to the movie doc
    await movie.save();
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err);
  }
  res.redirect(`/movies/${movie._id}`);
}
```

> Remember: `req.user` is the logged in user's Mongoose document!

### Update How Reviews are Being Displayed

Here's the updated **views/movies/show.ejs** that displays the user's name and avatar with each review:

```html
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>User</th>
      <th>Date</th>
      <th>Review</th>
      <th>Rating</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <% let total = 0 %>
    <% movie.reviews.forEach(function(r) { %>
      <% total += r.rating %>
      <tr>
        <td class="review-user"><img alt="avatar" src="<%= r.userAvatar %>" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" ><%= r.userName %></td>
        <td><%= r.createdAt.toLocaleDateString() %></td>
        <td><%= r.content %></td>
        <td><%= r.rating %></td>
      </tr>
    <% }); %>
    <tr>
      <td colspan="3"></td>
      <td><strong><%= (total / movie.reviews.length).toFixed(1) %></strong></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
```

> Note: The `referrerpolicy="no-referrer"` attribute added to the `<img>` cures Google's finickiness handling the browser's request for the avatar image.

Sprinkle in the the following CSS at the end of **public/stylesheets/style.css**:

```css
.review-user {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}

.review-user img {
  border-radius: 50%;
  height: 40px;
}
```

**Test the First User Story**

That should take care of our first user story - try it out!

Yes, the UX is not that great because of the full-page refresh, but we'll address that when we develop single-page apps with React.
