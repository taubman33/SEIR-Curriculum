### Step 9 - Define Routes for Authentication

We're going to need three auth related routes:

1. A route to handle the request sent when the user clicks Login with Google

2. The `/oauth2callback` route that we told Google to call after the user confirms or denies the OAuth login.

3. Lastly, we will need a route for the user to logout.

#### Step 9.1 Coding the Routes...

We're going to code these three new auth related routes in the existing `routes/index` module.

These new routes will need to access the `passport` module, so let's require it in **routes/index.js**:

```js
// routes/index.js

var router = require('express').Router();
// new code below
const passport = require('passport');
```

#### Step 9.2 Login Route

In **routes/index.js**, let's add the login route below the root route:

```js
// Google OAuth login route
router.get('/auth/google', passport.authenticate(
  // Which passport strategy is being used?
  'google',
  {
    // Requesting the user's profile and email
    scope: ['profile', 'email'],
    // Optionally force pick account every time
    // prompt: "select_account"
  }
));
``` 

The `passport.authenticate()` method will return a middleware function that does the coordinating with Google's OAuth server.

The user will be presented the consent screen if they haven't previously consented.

#### Step 9.3 Google Callback Route

Below the login route we just added, let's add the "callback" route that Google will call after the user confirms:

```js
// Google OAuth callback route
router.get('/oauth2callback', passport.authenticate(
  'google',
  {
    successRedirect: '/movies',
    failureRedirect: '/movies'
  }
));
```

Note that we can specify the redirects for a successful and unsuccessful login. For this app, we will redirect to our main `/movies` route in both cases.

#### Step 9.4 Logout Route

The last route to add is the route that will logout the user:

```js
// OAuth logout route
router.get('/logout', function(req, res){
  req.logout(function() {
    res.redirect('/movies');
  });
});
```
	
The `logout()` method was automatically added to the `req` object by Passport!

Good time to do another error check.

### Step 10 - Add Login/Logout UI

We want the nav bar in **views/partials/header.ejs** to update dynamically depending upon whether there's an authenticated user or not:

<br>

**versus**

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/0tt4eu3.png">

#### Step 10.1 Pass `req.user` to All Views via `res.locals` & Middleware

Instead of having to pass `req.user` every time we render a template, let's take advantage of Express' [res.locals](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html#res.locals) object and a tidy custom middleware function:

In **server.js**:

```js
app.use(passport.session());

// Add this middleware BELOW passport middleware
app.use(function (req, res, next) {
  res.locals.user = req.user;
  next();
});
```

Now the logged in user is in a `user` variable that's available inside all EJS templates!

If nobody is logged in, `user` will be `undefined`.

#### Step 10.2 Add the Login / Logout UI Logic

We're going to use an `if`/`else` block in the EJS to dynamically render the nav links depending upon whether there is a logged in user or not.

Here's the updated `<nav>` element in **partials/header.ejs**:

```html
<nav>
  <img src="/images/camera.svg">
  <a href="/movies" <%- title === 'All Movies' ? 'class="active"' : '' %>>ALL MOVIES</a>
  <% if (user) { %>
    <a href="/performers/new"	<%- title === 'Add Performer' ? 'class="active"' : '' %>>
		ADD PERFORMER</a>
    <a href="/movies/new" <%- title === 'Add Movie' ? 'class="active"' : '' %>>ADD MOVIE</a>
    <a href="/logout">LOG OUT</a>
  <% } else { %>
    <a href="/auth/google" class="login">LOG IN&nbsp;<img src="https://i.imgur.com/FHjYyi0.png"></a>
  <% } %>
</nav>
```

There's a `class="login"` in use - let's add the following to the bottom of **public/stylesheets/style.css**:

```css
.login {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  height: 34px;
}

.login img {
  height: 30px;
}
```

#### Step 10.3 Try Logging In/Out!

We've finally got to the point where you can test out our app's authentication!

May the force be with us!
