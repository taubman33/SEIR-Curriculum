## 1. Setup

This lesson will finalize mongoose-movies!

The starter code for this lesson begins where the Mongoose Queries Lab left off (which also seeded the database with some Movies and performers).

You only have to sync if your code is complete or is not working.

1. Move into the `mongoose-movies` project we started in the Intro to Mongoose lesson:
    ```
    cd ~/code/mongoose-movies
    ```
2. Again, you only have to sync if your code is complete or is not working:
    ```
    git reset --hard origin/sync-15-finish-seeding-query-lab
    ```
3. Open the project's folder in VS Code:
    ```
    code .
    ```
4. Open an integrated terminal session:
    ```
    control + backtick
    ```
5. Start the Express server:
    ```
    nodemon
    ```
6. Browse to `localhost:3000`

### Remove Any Existing Reviews

The upcoming user-centric change that's going to be made to the `reviewSchema` will prevent being able to add new reviews to any movie that currently has existing reviews (because they won't conform to the new schema).

Therefore, we need to clear out the `reviews` array exactly how/why we needed to clear out the `cast` array during the referencing lesson.

1. Open a new Node REPL:

```
node
```

2. Load crud-helper.js:

```
.load crud-helper.js
```

3. Run the following command to clear out all reviews:

```
Movie.updateMany({},  { reviews: [] }).then(console.log)
```

4. Exit the REPL:

```
.exit
```

Now back to our regularly scheduled programming...

## 2. Intro to Authentication

### Why We Need Authentication

An application's functionality typically revolves around a particular user.

For example, when we use online banking, or more importantly, save songs to our Spotify playlists, the application has to know who we are - and this is where **authentication** comes in.

### What is Authentication?

Authentication is what enables an application to know the **identity** of the person using it.

In SEI, we're going to learn 3 types of **authentication**:

- **Unit 2**: Logging in via a third-party provider (OAuth)
- **Unit 3**: Session-based username/password login
- **Unit 4**: Token-based username/password login

### Authentication vs. Authorization

_Authentication_ and _authorization_ are not the same thing...

**Authentication** verifies a user's identity.

**Authorization** determines what functionality a given user can access. For example:

- Features a logged in (authenticated) user has vs. an anonymous visitor
- Features an _admin_ user has vs. some other user _role_
- Only the user that added a given comment can delete that comment

## 3. Why OAuth?

Consider applications where we have to sign up and log in using a username and a password...

<details>
<summary>
‚ùì What pitfalls of username/password authentication can you think of from a user's perspective?
</summary>
<hr>

<ul>
  <li>Creating multiple logins requires you to remember and manage all of those login credentials.</li>
  <li>You will often use the same credentials across multiple sites, so if there's a security breach at one of the sites where you are a member, the hackers know that users often use the same credentials across all of their sites - oh snap!</li>
  <li>You are tempted to use simple/weak passwords so that you can remember all of them.</li>
</ul>

<hr>
</details>

<details>
<summary>
‚ùì What might be the pitfalls of username/password authentication from a business that owns the web app point of view?
</summary>
<hr>

<ul>
  <li>Managing users' credentials requires carefully crafted security code written by highly-paid developers.</li>
  <li>Users (customers) are annoyed by having to create dedicated accounts, especially for entertainment or personal interest type websites.</li>
  <li>Managing credentials makes your business a target for hackers (internal and external) and that brings with it liability.</li>
</ul>

<hr>
</details>

The bottom-line is that users prefer to use OAuth instead of creating another set of credentials to use your site.

When users are your customers, you want to make them as happy as possible!

OAuth is hot, so let's use it!

## 4. What is OAuth?

### A Bit of OAuth Vocabulary

- **[OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/)**: The current OAuth standard.  Version 1.0 is obsolete and should not be used.

- **OAuth provider**: A service company such as _Google_ that makes its OAuth authentication service available to third-party applications.

- **client application**: Our web application!  Remember, this is from an _OAuth provider's_ perspective.

- **owner**: A user of a service such as _Facebook_, _Google_, _Dropbox_, etc.

- **resources**: An _owner's_ information on a service that **may** be exposed to _client applications_. For example, a user of Dropbox may allow access to their files.

- **access token**: An temporary key that provides access to an _owner's_ _resources_.

- **scope**: Determines what _resources_ and rights (read-only, update, etc) a particular _token_ has.

### What is it?

OAuth is an open standard that provides **client applications** access to **resources** of a service such as Google with the permission of the resources' **owner**.

There are numerous OAuth Providers including:

- Facebook
- Google
- GitHub
- Twitter
- [Many more...](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_OAuth_providers)

### OAuth 2's Flow & Scope

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/pgb5FN9.png">

The above image, taken from [this excellent article](https://darutk.medium.com/diagrams-and-movies-of-all-the-oauth-2-0-flows-194f3c3ade85), diagrams the flow of logging in using OAuth 2.0.

The ultimate goal is for the _client application_ (our web app) to obtain an **access token** from an OAuth provider that allows the app to access the user's resources from that provider's API's.

OAuth is **token** based.  A token is a generated string of characters. 

Each token has a **scope** that determines what resources an app can access for that user.

For mongoose-movies, as is the case with many applications, we are only interested in using OAuth for identifying who the user is by accessing their basic profile info (**name**, **email** & **avatar**).

If an application needs to access more than a user's basic profile, the **scope** would need to be expanded as dictated by the specific provider's documentation on how to access additional resources.

Yes, OAuth is complex. But not to worry, we don't have to know all of the nitty gritty details in order to take advantage of it because we will be using PassportJS middleware that will handle most of the "OAuth dance" for us.

### ‚ùì OAuth Review Questions

<details>
<summary>
(1) True or False: If your site allows users to authenticate via OAuth, you should ensure they create a "strong" password.
</summary>
<hr>

<strong>False</strong> - Trick question because users won't be providing a password to our site if we use OAuth üòÄ

<hr>
</details>

<details>
<summary>
(2) To an OAuth provider, such as Google, what is the <em>client application</em>?
</summary>
<hr>

Our web application/server

<hr>
</details>

## 5. Preview the Completed `mongoose-movies` App

[The deployed mongoose-movies](https://mongoose-movies-sei.herokuapp.com/movies) includes OAuth authentication & authorization.

Here are some of the differences in the final code vs. where the app is now:

- The ability to log in and out with Google OAuth has been implemented.
- The navbar dynamically renders its links based upon whether a user is logged in or not.
- A `User` model has been added and when a user logs in for the first time the user is added to the database.
- The `Movie --< Review` relationship has been updated to be "user-centric", i.e., `Movie --< Review >-- User`

## 6. Today's OAuth Game Plan

Ready for some OAuth?  Here's today's game plan:

- **Step 1:** Register our App with Google's OAuth Server
- **Step 2:** Define the `User` model
- **Step 3:** Discuss PassportJS
- **Step 4:** Install & Configure Session middleware
- **Step 5:** Install PassportJS
- **Step 6:** Create a Passport config module
- **Step 7:** Install a Passport Strategy for OAuth
- **Step 8:** Configure Passport
- **Step 9:** Define routes for authentication
- **Step 10:** Add Login/Logout UI

Yep, lots of fun ahead...

### Step 1 - Register our App

Every OAuth provider requires that our web app be registered with it.

When we do so, we obtain a **Client ID** and a **Client Secret** that identifies **our application** to the OAuth provider.

For this lesson, we are going to use [Google's OAuth provider](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2).

Time to register our app...

#### Step 1.1 - Google Developers Console

- You must be logged into the [console for Google's Cloud Platform Console](https://console.developers.google.com).  Here's what you'll see once logged in to the console for the first time and consent to the Terms of Service:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/OjjoaRx.png">

#### Step 1.2 - Create a Project

- Click **Select a project**:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/XuqQCLu.png">

- Click **NEW PROJECT**:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ylSC8mW.png">

- Update the **Project name** to something like `mongoose-movies`, then click **CREATE**:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/dgKSFOG.png">

> Note: The project name must be globally unique, so Google will append and additional id to the name you provide.

- It might take a bit to create the project.  When done, click SELECT PROJECT:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/tPviNAe.png">

#### Step 1.3 - Enable the People API

- So that we can access the user's basic profile, we'll need to enable the People API.

- Click **Go to APIs overview**: 

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/dqFFhh3.png">

- Click **+ ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES**:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/HO1KJjY.png">

- Search for **people** and click on **Google People API** when it is visible:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/pUEqE4y.png">

- Click **ENABLE**:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ylHcvQK.png">

#### Step 1.4 - Obtain Credentials for App

- Now we need to create credentials for the app. Click **CREATE CREDENTIALS**:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/nayg9Ve.png">

- Select **User data** then click **NEXT**:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/FvPfXrY.png">

- Under **OAuth Consent Screen** provide a friendly **App name**, select the **User support email**, **leave App Logo blank**, type in a developer **Email address** then click SAVE AND CONTINUE:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/pSuDMeV.png">

- Ignore the **Scopes** section by clicking **SAVE AND CONTINUE** (you may have to scroll down a bit):

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/KrZDT91.png">

- In the dropdown, select **Web application**, then click the **+ ADD URI** in the **Authorized redirect URIs**:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Va5Ef86.png">

- Copy/paste `http://localhost:3000/oauth2callback` into the **URIs 1** input then click **CREATE**:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/UfwhOaA.png">

> üëÄ You will have to add an _**additional**_ entry in the **Authorized redirect URIs** once you have deployed your application to Heroku - something like `https://<your app name>.herokuapp.com/oauth2callback`.

- We now need to change the publishing status so that anyone can log in.  Click the **OAuth consent screen page** link:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/h9MbE5z.png">

- Click the **PUBLISH APP** button:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/uI9QDhX.png">

- Click the **CONFIRM**:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ztX7wvL.png">

- Awesome. Now let's go view our credentials by clicking **Credentials** in the side menu:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Wbu1uKR.png">

- Click the **Web client 1** link:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/gjK4cEk.png">

#### Step 1.5 - Add the Client ID and Client Secret to `.env`

Strangely, we either have to make our browser window very narrow or very large in order to see the **Client ID** and the **Client secret**:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/S1RcEu4.png">

Now we can add the credentials, along with that callback URI we provided, to the `.env` file so that it looks something like this:

```
DATABASE_URL=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0-oxnsb.azure.mongodb.net/mongoose-movies?retryWrites=true&w=majority
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=245025414218-2r7f4bvh3t88s3shh6hhagrki0f6op8t.apps.googleusercontent.com
GOOGLE_SECRET=Yn9T_2BKzxr5zgprzKDGI5j3
GOOGLE_CALLBACK=http://localhost:3000/oauth2callback
```

> üëÄ Registering a project with other OAuth providers will be similar, but unique to that provider.

**Congrats on Registering your App with Google's OAuth Service!**

### Step 2 - Define the `User` Model

Let's start by defining a minimal `User` model:

1. Create the Node module:

    ```
    touch models/user.js
    ```

2. Define the minimal schema, compile the schema into a `User` model and export it:

    ```js
    const mongoose = require('mongoose');
    const Schema = mongoose.Schema;

    const userSchema = new Schema({
      name: String
    }, {
      timestamps: true
    });

    module.exports = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);
    ```

We will add additional properties once we "discover" what user info Google provides us with.

### Step 3 - Passport Discussion

Implementing OAuth is complex. There are redirects going on everywhere, access tokens that only last for a short time, refresh tokens used to obtain a fresh access token, etc.

As usual, we will stand on the shoulders of giants that have done much of the heavy lifting for us - enter [PassportJS](http://www.passportjs.org/).

Passport is by far the most popular authentication framework out there for Express apps.

[Passport's website](http://passportjs.org/) states that it provides _Simple, unobtrusive authentication for Node.js_.

Basically this means that it handles much of the mundane tasks related to authentication for us, but leaves the details up to us, for example, not forcing us to configure our user model a certain way.

There are numerous types of authentication, if Passport itself was designed to do them all, it would be ginormous!

Instead, Passport uses **Strategies** designed to handle a given type of authentication. Think of them as plug-ins for Passport.

Each Express app with Passport can use one or more of these strategies.

[Passport's site](http://passportjs.org/) currently shows over 500 strategies available.

OAuth2, although a standard, can be implemented slightly differently by OAuth providers such as Facebook and Google.

As such, there are strategies available for each flavor of OAuth provider.

For this lesson, we will be using the [passport-google-oauth](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport-google-oauth) strategy.

Passport is just middleware designed to authenticate requests.

**IMPORTANT INFO BELOW**

When a request is sent from an authenticated user, Passport's middleware will automatically add a `user` property to the `req` object.

**üëÄ `req.user` will be the logged in user's Mongoose document‚ùóÔ∏è**

If a user is not logged in, `req.user` will be `undefined`.

You will then be able to access the `req.user` document in all of the controller actions - so, DO NOT write code to retrieve the user document from the DB because `req.user` is already the document!

### Step 4 - Session Middleware

Before we install Passport and a strategy, we need to install the [`express-session`](https://github.com/expressjs/session?_ga=1.40272994.1784656250.1446759094) middleware.

Sessions, are a server-side way of remembering a user's browser session.

Sessions remembers the browser session by setting a cookie that contains a _session id_. No other data is stored in the cookie, just the _id_ of the session.

On the server-side, your application can optionally store data pertaining to the user's session (`req.session`).

Passport will use the session, which is an in-memory data-store by default, to store a nugget of information that will allow us to lookup the user in the database.

FYI, since sessions are maintained in memory by default, if the server restarts, session data will be lost. You will see this happen when nodemon restarts the server and you are no longer logged in.

#### Step 4.1 - Installing Session Middleware

Let's install the module:

```
npm install express-session
```

Next, require it below the `logger`:

```js
var logger = require('morgan');
// new code below
var session = require('express-session');
```

#### Step 4.2 - Add a SECRET to `.env`

When session middleware is configured, it will require a "secret" string that it uses to digitally sign the session cookie.  Let's add the secret to the `.env`:

```
...
GOOGLE_CALLBACK=http://localhost:3000/oauth2callback
SECRET=SEIRocks
```

#### Step 4.3 - Configure and Mount Session Middleware

Now, we can configure and mount the session middleware below the `express.static` middleware:

```js
app.use(cookieParser());
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));

app.use(session({
  secret: process.env.SECRET,
  resave: false,
  saveUninitialized: true
}));
```

The `resave` and `saveUninitialized` settings, they are being set to suppress deprecation warnings.

#### Step 4.4 - Verifying Session Middleware

Make sure your server is running with nodemon.

Browse to the app at `localhost:3000`.

Open the _Application_ tab in _DevTools_, then expand _Cookies_ in the menu on the left.

A cookie named `connect.sid` confirms that the session middleware is doing its job.

**Congrats, the session middleware is now in place!**
