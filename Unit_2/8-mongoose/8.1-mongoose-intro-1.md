## 1. Demo of the `mongoose-movies` Reference Application

As we continue to learn new development concepts and techniques during this unit we'll be incorporating them in a reference app named [Mongoose Movies](https://mongoose-movies-sei.herokuapp.com/movies).

In fact, we'll be building a reference app for each full-stack unit that can be referred to when coding your labs and project.

## 2. Setup

We'll be learning about Mongoose over several lessons so a code-along repo has been set up to get started and to sync with if need be.

To get set up:

1. Move into your **code** folder:
    ```
    cd ~/code
    ```
2. Clone the repo containing the starter code:
    ```
    git clone https://git.generalassemb.ly/sei-blended-learning/mongoose-movies.git
    ```
3. Move into the newly created project **mongoose-movies** folder:
    ```
    cd mongoose-movies
    ```
4. Install the Node modules:
    ```
    npm i
    ```
5. Open the project in VS Code:
    ```
    code .
    ```
6. Open an integrated terminal in VS Code (`control + backtick`) and spin up the server:
    ```
    nodemon
    ```

Browsing to `localhost:3000` we find that the starter code is a skeleton Express server created using express-generator and updated as follows:
- As a best practice, `app.js` has been renamed to `server.js`
- Partial templates have been set up with some basic nav in `header.ejs`.

## 3. Intro to Mongoose

### What is Mongoose?

Yes, this guy, but not in the context of MongoDB...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Y74xxoD.jpg" width="900">

[Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) is software library called an **Object Document Mapper (ODM)** because it maps object-oriented JavaScript to MongoDB _documents_.

### Why use Mongoose?

Mongoose is the goto when performing CRUD data operations on a MongoDB database.

Using Mongoose is easier and more productive than working directly MongoDB.

As stated on Mongoose's homepage:

> "Mongoose provides a straight-forward, **schema-based** solution to model your application data..."_

Wait a minute, what's with this "schema" business, isn't MongoDB schema-less?  

Well, yes _MongoDB_ is, however, it turns out that the vast majority of applications benefit when their data conforms to a defined structure (schema).

In addition to ensuring that data conforms to schemas that we define Mongoose also provides lots of other useful functionality such as:

- Default property values
- Data validation
- Automatic related model population via the `populate` method
- _Virtual properties_ - create properties like "fullName" that are not persisted in the database
- Custom _Instance methods_ which operate on a document
- Custom _Static methods_ which operate on the entire collection 
- `pre` and `post` event lifecycle hooks (Mongoose "middleware")

### The Big Picture 

Here is a big picture overview of the purpose of Mongoose's **Schema** and **Model** components:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/JHatEmH.png">

#### Big Picture Example 

Assume we need to store cat documents with the following schema:

```js
// Module: models/cat.js

const catSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String,
  breed: String
});
```

`catSchema` can then be compiled into a Model and that Model exported like this:

```js
// By convention, the name of the Model is singular and UpperCamelCased
module.exports = mongoose.model('Cat', catSchema);
```

Then, in our controller actions, we can require the `Cat` model and use it to perform CRUD on the `cats` collection in the MongoDB:

```js
// Again, convention is to name the Model's
// variable as singular and UpperCamelCased
const Cat = require('./models/cat');
Cat.create({name: 'Morris', breed: 'Orange Tabby'})
  .then(function(catDoc) {
    console.log(catDoc);
  });
```

## 4. Using a `.env` File to Protect "Secrets"

A `.env` file is used to provide _environment_ variables (also called config vars).

Environment variables include the database's connection string and other secrets such as access tokens, etc.

Because they usually hold sensitive info, `.env` files should never be pushed to GitHub and thus need to be Git ignored.

Environment variables can also be used to configure an application's settings without changing the app's source code.

### Setting Up the `.env`

First, create a `.env` file in the project root:

```
touch .env
```

Install the `dotenv` Node module:

```
npm i dotenv
```

In **server.js**, require `dotenv` and call its `config()` method to "process" the `KEY=VALUE` pairs in the `.env`:

```js
// server.js

var logger = require('morgan');

// It's very important to require dotenv before any other module
// that depends upon the properties added to process.env 
require('dotenv').config();
```

Note that we're not assigning the returned value to a variable -  just simply coding `require('dotenv').config()` results in the `.env` file being "processed".

### Adding the Atlas MongoDB Connection String to the `.env`

Find and copy your [Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) MongoDB connection string that you previously created and tucked away for safe keeping.

In the `.env` file, add a key of `DATABASE_URL` followed by an equals sign (`=`) then paste in your connection string with no spaces resulting in something like this:

```
DATABASE_URL=mongodb+srv://someuser:somepassword@cluster0-oxpsb.azure.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

Note that every `KEY=VALUE` pair defined in `.env` will be available as a property on Node's `process.env` object, e.g., `process.env.DATABASE_URL`.


Next we need to insert the name of the database we want to create and connect to, `mongoose-movies` will work just fine for this project. Insert it between the `/?` characters like this:

```
DATABASE_URL=mongodb+srv://someuser:somepassword@cluster0-oxpsb.azure.mongodb.net/mongoose-movies?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

> üëÄ This might be a good time to  update your saved connection string in its new form for future use.  Just be sure to change the database name, e.g., change `/mongoose-movies?` to to `/another-db-name?` in your next project.

FYI, `nodemon` doesn't watch for changes in the `.env` file, so you may have to restart the server manually if you're not going to make some additional code changes.

## 5. Including Mongoose in a Project

To use Mongoose in our apps, we need to install and configure it...

### Install Mongoose

Installing the Mongoose module is straight forward:

```
npm i mongoose
```

> Reminder: `npm i` is a shortcut for `npm install`
	
### Connect to MongoDB using Mongoose in a module

We're going to create a separate module named `database.js` and put it in a folder named `config`:

```
mkdir config
touch config/database.js
```

Then in `database.js`, let's connect to a database named `movies`:

```js
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

mongoose.connect(process.env.DATABASE_URL);
```
	
As you know, the code in a Node module doesn't execute until the module is required, therefore, to connect to the database, we'll require `database.js` in `server.js`:

```js
var logger = require('morgan');

require('dotenv').config();
// connect to the database with AFTER the config vars are processed
require('./config/database');
```

Again, there's no need to assign to a variable because we're not exporting anything useful.

### Verify the Connection 

Errors in the Express terminal - look closely, it's probably a failure to authenticate with Alas error - please double-check your connection string and its credentials.

No errors in the Express terminal?  Great!  However, wouldn't it be nice to know that our connection to our database was successful?  Sure it would...

### Adding event listeners to the Mongoose connection

The Mongoose connection object inherits from Node's `EventEmitter` which allows us to listen to defined events.

Let's listen to the `connected` event by modifying the `database.js` module as follows:

```js
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

mongoose.connect(process.env.DATABASE_URL);
	
// shortcut to mongoose.connection object
const db = mongoose.connection;
	
db.on('connected', function() {
  console.log(`Connected to MongoDB ${db.name} at ${db.host}:${db.port}`);
});
```

After saving, `nodemon` will restart the server and you should see the  _Connected to MongoDb..._ message in the Express terminal.
