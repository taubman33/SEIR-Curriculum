## 1. Setup

The starter code for this lesson has been updated from where we left off last lesson, so be sure to follow the following to sync your code...

1. Move into the `mongoose-movies` project we started in the Intro to Mongoose lesson:
    ```
    cd ~/code/mongoose-movies
    ```
2. ðŸ‘‰ Sync your code with the starter code for this lesson (mandatory):

    ```
    git reset --hard origin/sync-7-embedding-starter
    ```
3. Open the project's folder in VS Code:
    ```
    code .
    ```
4. Open an integrated terminal session:
    ```
    control + backtick
    ```
5. Start the Express server:
    ```
    nodemon
    ```
6. Browse to `localhost:3000`

## 2. Review the Starter Code

As you can see, a bit of styling has been added since the previous lesson.

There's no more "Home" page - the root route defined in **routes/index.js** is redirecting to `/movies` (movies index functionality).

All `res.render()` calls are passing in a `title` property for the page title and to dynamically add an `active` class to the currently active link in the nav bar.

Like we did in the express-todos app, **show** functionality has been added using a **show** route definition that maps to a `show` controller action for viewing a single movie:

- **views/movies/index.ejs** shows a "DETAILS" link that will send a request to the proper `show` route: `GET /movies/:id`.

- EJS tags write the movie's `_id` into the `href` attribute.

- The `moviesCtrl.show` action is using the `Movie.findById` method and `req.params.id`.

## 3. The `Movie --< Review` Relationship

**`Movie --< Review`**

- _A Movie has many Reviews_
- _A Review belongs to a Movie_

It may be helpful to think of one-to-many relationships as a **parent**/**child** relationship.

### Embed or Reference Reviews?

If `mongoose-movies` was using a SQL Database there would have to be both a `Movie` and a `Review` model used to perform CRUD data operations in a "movies" and "reviews" table.

However, when implementing related data using MongoDB/Mongoose, we usually have a choice between **embedding** and **referencing**...

#### Referencing Reviews

**Referencing** allows us to "link" related documents by storing one of the document's `ObjectId` in the other document.

Here's what using **referencing** to relate a movie and its reviews might look like:

```js
// A movie document stored
// in the movies collection
{
  nowShowing: false,
  _id: new ObjectId("633e094fa9ba1e2600e6c9f6"),
  title: 'Star Wars - A New Hope',
  releaseYear: 1977,
  cast: ['Mark Hamill', 'Carrie Fisher'],
  createdAt: 2021-10-05T22:46:39.860Z,
  updatedAt: 2021-10-05T22:46:39.860Z,
  __v: 0
}
```
and its reviews might look something like this:
```js
// A review document stored
// in the reviews collection
{
  _id: new Object("605d17435dc2532a429a17d0"),
  // Store/reference the ObjectId
  // of the movie doc that it belongs to
  movie: new ObjectId("633e094fa9ba1e2600e6c9f6"),
  content: 'Still my favorite!',
  rating: 5,
  createdAt: 2022-11-03T13:00:44.130Z,
  updatedAt: 2022-11-03T13:00:44.130Z,
}
// Another review document
{
  _id: new Object("605d17435dc2532a429a17d0"),
  movie: new ObjectId("633e094fa9ba1e2600e6c9f6"),
  content: 'Entertaining...',
  rating: 4,
  createdAt: 2022-04-01T11:20:44.130Z,
  updatedAt: 2022-04-01T11:20:44.130Z,
}
```

Note above how each review document has a `movie` property that holds the `ObjectId` of the movie document that it "belongs to".

When using referencing, typically the two types of documents, in this case review and movie documents, are stored in separate collections using separate models.

Because only a single collection can be queried at a time, referencing requires two separate database queries to access both a movie and its reviews.

This is the reason _embedding_ is considerably more efficient...

#### Embedding Reviews

In MongoDB/Mongoose, one-to-many relationships can be implemented using **embedding**.

Embedding is when a child subdocument (review) is  **embedded** within its parent document (movie).

For example:

```js
{
  nowShowing: false,
  _id: new ObjectId("633e094fa9ba1e2600e6c9f6"),
  title: 'Star Wars - A New Hope',
  releaseYear: 1977,
  cast: ['Mark Hamill', 'Carrie Fisher'],
  reviews: [
    {
      _id: new Object("605d17435dc2532a429a17d0"),
      content: 'Still my favorite!',
      rating: 5,
      createdAt: 2022-11-03T13:00:44.130Z,
      updatedAt: 2022-11-03T13:00:44.130Z,
    },
    {
      _id: new Object("605d17435dc2532a429a17d0"),
      content: 'Entertaining...',
      rating: 4,
      createdAt: 2022-04-01T11:20:44.130Z,
      updatedAt: 2022-04-01T11:20:44.130Z,
    },
  ],
  createdAt: 2021-10-05T22:46:39.860Z,
  updatedAt: 2021-10-05T22:46:39.860Z,
  __v: 0
}
```

This `Movie --< Review` relationship is a perfect use case for using MongoDB/Mongoose embedding!

### ERD for `mongoose-movies`

Here's what an ERD that models the<br>`Movie --< Review`<br>relationship might look like:

## Subdocuments

When we embed related data, we refer to that embedded data as a **subdocument**.

Subdocuments are very similar to regular documents.

The key difference being that they themselves are not saved directly to the database - they are saved when the document they are embedded within is saved.

Subdocuments still require that a **schema** be defined so that the data can be validated and/or the application can depend upon the "shape" of its data.

However, because subdocuments are not saved to their own collection, **there is no model**, just a schema!

## 5. Define a Schema for Review Subdocuments

Okay, so we need to define a `reviewSchema`.

Only the `movieSchema` code needs to reference `reviewSchema`, so a great place to define it is just above the `movieSchema` in **models/movie.js**:

```js
const reviewSchema = new Schema({
  content: {
    type: String,
    required: true
  },
  rating: {
    type: Number,
    min: 1,
    max: 5,
    default: 5
  }
}, {
  timestamps: true
});

const movieSchema = new Schema({
```

With `reviewSchema` defined, we can now use it within the `movieSchema` as follows:

```js
const movieSchema = new Schema({
  ...
  nowShowing: { type: Boolean, default: false },
  // reviews is an array of review subdocs!
  reviews: [reviewSchema]
}, {
  timestamps: true
});
```
