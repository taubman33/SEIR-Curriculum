## 9. Use a Model to Create Data in a Node REPL

Now that we have a model, we're ready to perform some CRUD.

First up is **creating** data!

We can use a Mongoose Model in two ways to create documents in the collection:

1. `const instance = new Model(<object>)`, then`instance.save()`<br>-OR-

2. `Model.create(<object or array of objects>)`

#### Creating documents in a Node REPL

Before writing the code in the app to create movies, let's do so in a Node REPL...

Warning, if you make a typo, you'll have to start over:

```
node
> require('dotenv').config()   // Necessary if connection string in a .env file
> require('./config/database')
> const Movie = require('./models/movie')
> Movie.create({
... title: 'Star Wars - A New Hope',
... releaseYear: 1977
... }).then(console.log)
```

> Pretty neat how we can provide the `console.log` method as the onFulfilled callback function.

Logged out will be a document that looks something like...

```js
{ __v: 0,
  title: 'Star Wars - A New Hope',
  releaseYear: 1977,
  _id: 57ea692bab09506a97e969ba,
  cast: []
}
```

> Note: The `__v` field is added by Mongoose to track versioning - ignore it.

Note that we did not provide a value for `nowShowing` so it was not created as a property in the document.

However, properties of type `Array`, are always initialized to empty arrays like `cast` was. This makes it convenient to start pushing performers into  it!

That was fun! Exit the REPL (`ctrl + C` twice) and lets see how we can use<br>`new` + `save`<br>to create movie documents - but this time from within our app...

## 10. Review the 5-Step Process to Add a Feature to a Web App

Once again, here is the process we repeat over and over when adding a feature, including CRUD functionality, in a web app:

1. Determine the "proper" route (HTTP Method & Endpoint).  Use RESTful conventions whenever possible.
2. Add the UI (link and/or form) that will trigger the HTTP request that matches the route.
3. Define the route in the appropriate router module that will match the HTTP request and map it to the `<controller>.<method>` that will perform the desired functionality.
4. Add and code the controller action/function to perform any necessary CRUD, etc. and be sure to export it.
5. In the controller, in the case of a `GET` request, respond with `res.render` (optionally passing data to the view). Or, when data has been mutated (`POST`, `PUT` & `DELETE`) use a `res.redirect`. If rendering, code the view template if necessary.

## 11. Implement the `new` Functionality

#### Creating Data is sometimes a two-request process...

Remember, creating data functionality might be a two-request process:

1. First request displays a form for the user to enter the data (the `new` functionality/controller action)
2. Second request to submit the form to the server where the data is created (the `create` functionality/controller action)

Yup, the `new` & `create` actions are partners!

### Displaying a `<form>` to enter a new movie  

#### Step 1 - Determine the "proper" route (HTTP Method & Endpoint)

Using our trusty [Routing Chart](https://gist.github.com/jim-clark/17908763db7bd3c403e6), we find that to display a `new.ejs` view with a form for entering movies, the proper route will be:

```
GET /movies/new
```

#### Step 2 - Add the UI

üëâ **YOU DO** - Add a Navigation Hyperlink <small>(1 min)</small>

1. Inside of the existing `<nav>` element in **views/partials/header.ejs**, add a hyperlink (`<a>` tag) that when clicked will result in the browser sending the HTTP request for the route we just identified above.

2. The hyperlink should display **New Movie** like this:

    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/ejKwWy8.png">

    > üëÄ Note that a `&nbsp;|&nbsp;` has been inserted between the links to provide separation.

#### Step 3 - Define the route on the server

Express generator stubbed up a `users.js` route module that we will convert and use for the movies resource.

Rename the file to `movies.js`.

Due to the renaming, we'll need to make a couple of changes in `server.js`...

<details>
<summary>
‚ùì What two lines of code need to be updated? 
</summary>
<hr>

<code>var usersRouter = require('./routes/users');</code>
<br>and<br>
<code>app.use('/users', usersRouter);</code>

<hr>
</details>

Inside of `routes/movies.js`, let's code the route that maps the HTTP request to the `new` action:

```js
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
// You'll be creating this controller module next
const moviesCtrl = require('../controllers/movies');
	
// GET /movies/new
router.get('/new', moviesCtrl.new);
	
module.exports = router;
```

#### Step 4 - Add the controller action/method and be sure to export it

üëâ **YOU DO** - Create the **movies** Controller <small>(3 mins)</small>

**Create the controller module, export the `new` action and stub up the `newMovie` function** - we've done this quite a few times already so do your best not to look below...

1. Create the `controllers/movies.js` module.

2. The `new` action is just the first of several that are going to be exported from this module:

	```js
	module.exports = {
	  new: newMovie
	};
	```
	Remember, we can't name a function `new` because it's a reserved word, but `newMovie` works!

3. Stub up the `newMovie` function:

	```js
	function newMovie(req, res) {
	  
	}
	```

#### Code the controller action/method

There's no CRUD to perform in this `new` action, we just need to render a **new.ejs**:

```js
function newMovie(req, res) {
  // We'll want to be able to render an
  // errorMsg if the create action fails
  res.render('movies/new', { errorMsg: '' });
}
```

#### Step 5 -  Create the View

Now we need the `new.ejs` view.

As we've discussed, organizing views for a data resource into a dedicated folder makes sense.  In Terminal:

```
mkdir views/movies
touch views/movies/new.ejs
```

Copy and paste the following awesome but ugly form, then we'll review it...

```html
<%- include('../partials/header') %>

<h2>Enter a New Movie</h2>
<form action="/movies" method="POST">
  <label>Title:
    <input type="text" name="title">
  </label><br>
  <label>Release Year:
    <input type="number" name="releaseYear">
  </label><br>
  <label>MPAA Rating
    <select name="mpaaRating">
      <option value="G">G</option>
      <option value="PG">PG</option>
      <option value="PG-13">PG-13</option>
      <option value="R">R</option>
    </select>
  </label><br>
  <label>Cast (separate actors with commas):
    <input type="text" name="cast">
  </label><br>
  <label>Now Showing:
    <input type="checkbox" name="nowShowing" checked>
  </label><br>
  <button type="submit">Add Movie</button>
</form>
<p><%= errorMsg %></p>

<%- include('../partials/footer') %>
```

#### Test the `new` Functionality 

Clicking the **New Movie** link should now display
