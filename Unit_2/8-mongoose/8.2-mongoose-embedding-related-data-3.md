## 7. Displaying Reviews

Here's the User Story:

_**AAU, when viewing the detail page for a movie, I want to see a list of the movie's reviews**_

### Displaying a Movie's Reviews

All that's left is to update **movies/show.ejs** to render the movie's reviews.

The only thing new below is the use of a `if..else` to render differently if there's no reviews yet.

Let's stub up that `if..else` so that we get some practice using EJS:

```html
<!-- views/movies/show.ejs -->

...

</form>

<!-- New markup below -->

<% if (movie.reviews.length) { %>

<% } else { %>

<% } %>
```

There's nothing new between the `if..else`, so let's copy/paste it:

```html
</form>

<!-- New markup below -->

<% if (movie.reviews.length) { %>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Date</th>
        <th>Review</th>
        <th>Rating</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <% movie.reviews.forEach(function(r) { %>
        <tr>
          <!-- .toLocaleDateString() provides a more friendly date format -->
          <td><%= r.createdAt.toLocaleDateString() %></td>
          <td><%= r.content %></td>
          <td><%= r.rating %></td>
        </tr>
      <% }); %>
    </tbody>
  </table>
<% } else { %>
  <h5>No Reviews Yet</h5>
<% } %>
```

Note how we access the reviews array using `movie.reviews`.

### Try Adding Reviews!

Assuming no typos, you should be able to add reviews - congrats!

Let's wrap up with some essential questions before you start on the lab to practice this stuff!

Also, don't forget to check out the<br>_Further Study_ section which shows you how to:

- Retrieve a subdocument embedded in a Mongoose array
- Remove a subdocument from a Mongoose array, and
- Query for a document that contains a certain subdocument!

## 8. ‚ùì Essential Questions

<details>
<summary>
(1) True or False: All schemas must be compiled into a Model.
</summary>
<hr>

False.  We just used <code>reviewSchema</code> for the purpose of embedding reviews, however, we never compiled it into a model.

<hr>
</details>

<details>
<summary>
(2) Is it more efficient to embed or reference related data?
</summary>
<hr>

<strong>Embed</strong> because we can retrieve a document and its related data in a single query.

<hr>
</details>

<details>
<summary>
(3) True or False: An embedded subdocument must have its <code>save()</code> method called to be persisted to the database.
</summary>
<hr>

False.  Tricky question because embedded subdocs are saved when the top-level document they are embedded within is saved.

## 9. Further Study

#### Retrieve a Subdocument from a Mongoose Array

Mongoose arrays have an `id()` method used to find a subdocument based on the subdoc's `_id`:

```js
// Assume reviewId is an ObjectId or its string representation
const reviewDoc = movieDoc.reviews.id(reviewId);
```

> Note that `reviewId` would represent the `_id` of the embedded _review_ subdoc, not the _movie_ doc.

#### Remove a Subdocument from a Mongoose Array

Mongoose arrays have a `remove()` method that can be used to remove subdocuments by their `_id`:

```js
movieDoc.reviews.remove(reviewId);
```

Subdocuments themselves use their `deleteOne()` method to remove them from the array:

```js
// Remove the embedded review subdoc that has an `_id` equal to `reviewId`
movieDoc.reviews.id(reviewId).deleteOne();
// Don't forget to save `movieDoc` to persist the deletion!
```

#### Query for a Document that Contains a Certain Subdocument

There's an amazing syntax that you can use to query documents based upon the properties of subdocs.

```js
// Find the movie that contains a certain review
const movie = await Movie.findOne({ 'reviews._id': req.params.reviewId });
  // Wow, `movie` will be the doc that contains the review with an `_id`
  // that equals that of the `req.params.reviewId` route parameter!
```

> Note that the **dot property syntax** must be enclosed in quotes.

For another example, let's say you wanted to find all movies with at least one review with a 5 rating:

```js
const highlyRatedMovies = await Movie.find({ 'reviews.rating': 5 });
console.log('Great Movies:', highlyRatedMovies);  // wow!
```

`reviews.rating` represents the `rating` property on the subdocs withing the `reviews` array!
