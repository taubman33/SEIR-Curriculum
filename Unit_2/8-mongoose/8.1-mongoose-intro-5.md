## 13. Use a Model to Read Data

The querying ability of Mongoose is **very** capable.  For example:

```js
const movies = await Movie.find({ mpaaRating: 'PG' })
  .where('releaseYear').lt(1970)
  .where('cast').in('Bob Hope')
  .sort('-title')
  .limit(3)
  .select('title releaseYear');
``` 

The above query builder syntax is unique to Mongoose and is not available in MongoDB.

Powerful?  Yes, but we're going to start with the basics!

### Useful Model methods to query for data 

Here are the common Model methods for querying data:

| Method | Purpose | Syntax |
|---|---|---|
| `find` | Returns an array of all documents matching the _query object_ | `const movies = await Movie.find({mpaaRating: 'PG'})`|
|`findById` | Find a document based on it's `_id` | `const movie = await Movie.findById(req.params.id)`|
|`findOne`| Find the first document that matches the _query object_ | `const movie = await Movie.findOne({releaseYear: 2000})`|

> Note: An empty query object, `{}`, selects ALL documents.

## 14. Implement `index` Functionality

If you're feeling up to it, pause the video and give the following exercise that implements the movies `index` functionality a go.

However, it's fully understandable if you'd like to follow along with me!

ðŸ’ª **Practice Exercise** - Implement the movies `index` functionality that displays the list of movies <small>(20 mins)</small>

1. Identify the RESTful route

2. Add the UI to trigger the request by adding an "All Movies" link next to the "New Movie" link we added previously to `views/partials/header.ejs`:

    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/xcHq2Dp.png">

3. Define the RESTful route

4. Stub up and export the movie controller's `index` action.

5. Code the `index` action to:
	- Use the `Movie` model to query for all movies.  As mentioned above, use an empty query object to retrieve all documents. 
	- Render a `movies/index.ejs` view, providing to it the movies just retrieved.

6. Create a **views/movies/index.ejs** view to display in an HTML table.  Here's most of the markup - please complete according to the comments:

    ```html
    <%- include('../partials/header') %>

    <h2>Movie List</h2>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Title</th>
          <th>Release Year</th>
          <th>Rating</th>
          <th>Cast</th>
          <th>Now Showing</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <!-- Write the line of EJS to iterate over movies using forEach -->
          <tr>
            <td><%= m.title %></td>
            <td><%= m.releaseYear %></td>
            <td><%= m.mpaaRating %></td>
            <td><%= m.cast.join(', ') %></td>
            <!-- finish the ternary expression to display 'Yes' or 'Nope' --> 
            <td><%= m.nowShowing ?  %></td>
          </tr>
        <!-- Close the forEach using EJS here -->
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <%- include('../partials/header') %>
    ```

Now a quick refactor...

### Refactor the `create` Action's Redirect

Now that we have an `index` view, let's update the `redirect` in the `create` action:

```js
// controllers/movies.js

async function create() {
  ...
  try {
    await Movie.create(req.body);
    // Always redirect after CUDing data
    // We'll refactor to redirect to the movies index after we implement it
    res.redirect('/movies');  // Update this line
    ...
}
```

**Congrats on implementing `new` and `create` functionality!**

### Further Study or Code-Along?

We always encourage practicing expanding your learning on your own by reviewing the Further Study sections.

However, this time, the option is yours, you can stop the video and implement default values and validation on your own, or feel to follow along as I take you through it!
