### _AAU, when viewing a movie's detail page, I want to be able to add a new performer to the list_

Thinking about the steps necessary to implement the above user story:

- We will use a `<form>` to send an HTTP request used to to associate a performer and movie on the server.
- The `<form>` will include a `<select>` dropdown to include the selected performer's `_id` in the payload of the request. 
- The movies controller's `show` function will provide the list of performers used to render the `<option>` tags for the dropdown, however, we only want to include the performers in the dropdown that are not already in the cast!

Let's do this - here's our wireframe:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Zg0pCYa.png">

#### Passing the _Performers_ for the `<select>` Dropdown

Currently, the `moviesCtrl.show` function is just passing the `movie`, but now it also needs to query for the _performers_ that are not already associated with the `movie` and pass them to **show.ejs** as well.

First, we're going to need to access the `Performer` model, so require it at the top of **controllers/movies.js**:

```js
const Movie = require('../models/movie');
// require the Performer model
const Performer = require('../models/performer');
```
	
Now we're ready to refactor the `show` action, we'll review as we refactor the code:

```js
async function show(req, res) {
  // Populate the cast array with performer docs instead of ObjectIds
  const movie = await Movie.findById(req.params.id).populate('cast');
  // Mongoose query builder approach to retrieve performers not the movie:
    // Performer.find({}).where('_id').nin(movie.cast)
  // The native MongoDB approach uses a query object to find 
  // performer docs whose _ids are not in the movie.cast array like this:
  const performers = await Performer.find({ _id: { $nin: movie.cast } }).sort('name');
  console.log(performers);
  res.render('movies/show', { title: 'Movie Detail', movie, performers });
}
```

> üëÄ Refer to MongoDB's [$nin operator](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/nin/) docs for more info.

The `console.log` will show we are retrieving the _performers_ - a good baby step at this point. 

#### Render the `<form>` in **movies/show.ejs**

Again, there are comments to help us as we refactor **show.ejs** to render

```html
<!-- movies/show.ejs -->
	
<!-- add to cast form below this comment -->
<form id="add-per-to-cast" action="???" method="POST">
  <select name="performerId">
    <!-- Emit an option for each performer -->
    <%- performers.map(p => 
      `<option value="${p._id}">${p.name}</option>`
    ).join('') %>
  </select>
  <button type="submit">Add to Cast</button>
</form>
```

We'll come back and update the `action` attribute after we determine the proper route.

Now let's add this bit of CSS to end of **public/stylesheets/style.css** to tidy up the cast list:

```css
#show-page ul {
  margin: 0 0 2rem;
  padding: 0;
  list-style: none;
}
	
#show-page li {
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

#### Identify the Proper Route to Perform the Association

Let's check out the [Routing Guide](https://gist.github.com/jim-clark/17908763db7bd3c403e6) to find the endpoint (keep looking...).

The route is RESTful for adding an association between a movie and a performer but it's up to us to think of a good name for that action.

Note that there are two proper routes, however, the one that matches our scenario where the id of the performer is being sent in the payload of the request, is this one:

```
POST /movies/:id/performers
```

Remember, you can call the `:id` route parameter something like `:movieId` if it helps avoid confusion.

#### üëâ You Do - Update the `<form>`'s `<action>` Attribute (1 min)

- Now that the proper route has been identified, update the `action="???"` in the Add to Cast `<form>`.

<hr>

<code>
&lt;form id="add-per-to-cast" action="/movies/<%= movie._id %>/performers" method="POST"&gt;
</code>

<hr>
</details>

#### Add the Route for the _Add to Cast_ `<form>` Post

We could add the route and controller function used to perform the association in either resource's modules, but we'll go with _performers_ because it's not as crowded:

In **routes/performers.js**:

```js
// POST /movies/:id/performers
router.post('/movies/:id/performers', performersCtrl.addToCast);
```
`addToCast` - not a bad name!

Last step coming up!

#### Code the `addToCast` Controller Action

All that's left is to code the `addToCast` controller function:

```js
// controllers/performers.js
	
module.exports = {
  new: newPerformer,
  create,
  addToCast
};
	
async function addToCast(req, res) {
  const movie = await Movie.findById(req.params.id);
  // The cast array holds the performer's ObjectId (referencing)
  movie.cast.push(req.body.performerId);
  await movie.save();
  res.redirect(`/movies/${movie._id}`);
}
```

Reads like a book!

<hr>

<p>In a 1:M relationship, the "child" document belongs to only one parent and we have to create that dedicated child document.</p>

<p>However, in a M:M relationship, we are associating existing documents and they can have/belong to any number of documents.</p>
