## 12. Implement the `create` Functionality 

Here we go again...

#### Step 1 - Determine the "proper" route (HTTP Method & Endpoint)

Note that we've already set the `action` & `method` attributes to match the proper RESTful route to submit the form to.

**Identify the HTTP Method and Endpoint**

#### Step 2 - Add the UI

âœ… Yep, we already have the `<form>` that is going to trigger the request.

#### Step 3 - Define the route on the server

Define the create route in **routes/movies.js**:

```js
// GET /movies/new
router.get('/new', moviesCtrl.new);
// POST /movies
router.post('/', moviesCtrl.create);
```

#### Step 4 - Add and code the controller action/method and be sure to export it

The next step is to stub up and export that `create` controller action in **controllers/movies.js**:

```js
module.exports = {
  new: newMovie,
  create
};

async function create(req, res) {

}
```

> ðŸ‘€ We're going to be mostly using the modern `async/await` approach when consuming promises vs. using `.then()` because, well, `async/await` simply rock!

We're going to be using our `Movie` model, so we need to require it at the top:

```js
const Movie = require('../models/movie');
```

Now let's write the code that will use the `Movie` Model to create the movie submitted by the form - we'll review it as we type it...

```js
async function create(req, res) {
  // convert nowShowing's checkbox of nothing or "on" to boolean
  req.body.nowShowing = !!req.body.nowShowing;
  // remove any whitespace at start and end of cast
  req.body.cast = req.body.cast.trim();
  // split cast into an array if it's not an empty string - using a regular expression as a separator
  if (req.body.cast) req.body.cast = req.body.cast.split(/\s*,\s*/);
  try {
    await Movie.create(req.body);
    // Always redirect after CUDing data
    // We'll refactor to redirect to the movies index after we implement it
    res.redirect('/movies/new');
  } catch (err) {
    // Typically some sort of validation error
    console.log(err);
    res.render('movies/new', { errorMsg: err.message });
  }
}
```

#### Step 5 -  Redirect

We've already coded the `redirect` above and have no view to code.

#### Test the `create` Functionality 

You should now be able to submit movies - congrats!

Now that we've created a movie or two, let's see how we use Mongoose models to read documents from a MongoDB collection...
