## 1. Setup

The starter code for this lesson has been updated from where we left off last lesson, so be sure to follow the following to sync your code...

1. Move into the `mongoose-movies` project we started in the Intro to Mongoose lesson:
    ```
    cd ~/code/mongoose-movies
    ```
2. üëâ Sync your code with the starter code for this lesson (mandatory):

    ```
    git reset --hard origin/sync-7-embedding-starter
    ```
3. Open the project's folder in VS Code:
    ```
    code .
    ```
4. Open an integrated terminal session:
    ```
    control + backtick
    ```
5. Start the Express server:
    ```
    nodemon
    ```
6. Browse to `localhost:3000`

## 2. Review the Starter Code

As you can see, a bit of styling has been added since the previous lesson.

There's no more "Home" page - the root route defined in **routes/index.js** is redirecting to `/movies` (movies index functionality).

All `res.render()` calls are passing in a `title` property for the page title and to dynamically add an `active` class to the currently active link in the nav bar.

Like we did in the express-todos app, **show** functionality has been added using a **show** route definition that maps to a `show` controller action for viewing a single movie:

- **views/movies/index.ejs** shows a "DETAILS" link that will send a request to the proper `show` route: `GET /movies/:id`.

- EJS tags write the movie's `_id` into the `href` attribute.

- The `moviesCtrl.show` action is using the `Movie.findById` method and `req.params.id`.

## 3. The `Movie --< Review` Relationship

**`Movie --< Review`**

- _A Movie has many Reviews_
- _A Review belongs to a Movie_

It may be helpful to think of one-to-many relationships as a **parent**/**child** relationship.

### Embed or Reference Reviews?

If `mongoose-movies` was using a SQL Database there would have to be both a `Movie` and a `Review` model used to perform CRUD data operations in a "movies" and "reviews" table.

However, when implementing related data using MongoDB/Mongoose, we usually have a choice between **embedding** and **referencing**...

#### Referencing Reviews

**Referencing** allows us to "link" related documents by storing one of the document's `ObjectId` in the other document.

Here's what using **referencing** to relate a movie and its reviews might look like:

```js
// A movie document stored
// in the movies collection
{
  nowShowing: false,
  _id: new ObjectId("633e094fa9ba1e2600e6c9f6"),
  title: 'Star Wars - A New Hope',
  releaseYear: 1977,
  cast: ['Mark Hamill', 'Carrie Fisher'],
  createdAt: 2021-10-05T22:46:39.860Z,
  updatedAt: 2021-10-05T22:46:39.860Z,
  __v: 0
}
```
and its reviews might look something like this:
```js
// A review document stored
// in the reviews collection
{
  _id: new Object("605d17435dc2532a429a17d0"),
  // Store/reference the ObjectId
  // of the movie doc that it belongs to
  movie: new ObjectId("633e094fa9ba1e2600e6c9f6"),
  content: 'Still my favorite!',
  rating: 5,
  createdAt: 2022-11-03T13:00:44.130Z,
  updatedAt: 2022-11-03T13:00:44.130Z,
}
// Another review document
{
  _id: new Object("605d17435dc2532a429a17d0"),
  movie: new ObjectId("633e094fa9ba1e2600e6c9f6"),
  content: 'Entertaining...',
  rating: 4,
  createdAt: 2022-04-01T11:20:44.130Z,
  updatedAt: 2022-04-01T11:20:44.130Z,
}
```

Note above how each review document has a `movie` property that holds the `ObjectId` of the movie document that it "belongs to".

When using referencing, typically the two types of documents, in this case review and movie documents, are stored in separate collections using separate models.

Because only a single collection can be queried at a time, referencing requires two separate database queries to access both a movie and its reviews.

This is the reason _embedding_ is considerably more efficient...

#### Embedding Reviews

In MongoDB/Mongoose, one-to-many relationships can be implemented using **embedding**.

Embedding is when a child subdocument (review) is  **embedded** within its parent document (movie).

For example:

```js
{
  nowShowing: false,
  _id: new ObjectId("633e094fa9ba1e2600e6c9f6"),
  title: 'Star Wars - A New Hope',
  releaseYear: 1977,
  cast: ['Mark Hamill', 'Carrie Fisher'],
  reviews: [
    {
      _id: new Object("605d17435dc2532a429a17d0"),
      content: 'Still my favorite!',
      rating: 5,
      createdAt: 2022-11-03T13:00:44.130Z,
      updatedAt: 2022-11-03T13:00:44.130Z,
    },
    {
      _id: new Object("605d17435dc2532a429a17d0"),
      content: 'Entertaining...',
      rating: 4,
      createdAt: 2022-04-01T11:20:44.130Z,
      updatedAt: 2022-04-01T11:20:44.130Z,
    },
  ],
  createdAt: 2021-10-05T22:46:39.860Z,
  updatedAt: 2021-10-05T22:46:39.860Z,
  __v: 0
}
```

This `Movie --< Review` relationship is a perfect use case for using MongoDB/Mongoose embedding!

### ERD for `mongoose-movies`

Here's what an ERD that models the<br>`Movie --< Review`<br>relationship might look like:

## Subdocuments

When we embed related data, we refer to that embedded data as a **subdocument**.

Subdocuments are very similar to regular documents.

The key difference being that they themselves are not saved directly to the database - they are saved when the document they are embedded within is saved.

Subdocuments still require that a **schema** be defined so that the data can be validated and/or the application can depend upon the "shape" of its data.

However, because subdocuments are not saved to their own collection, **there is no model**, just a schema!

## 5. Define a Schema for Review Subdocuments

Okay, so we need to define a `reviewSchema`.

Only the `movieSchema` code needs to reference `reviewSchema`, so a great place to define it is just above the `movieSchema` in **models/movie.js**:

```js
const reviewSchema = new Schema({
  content: {
    type: String,
    required: true
  },
  rating: {
    type: Number,
    min: 1,
    max: 5,
    default: 5
  }
}, {
  timestamps: true
});

const movieSchema = new Schema({
```

With `reviewSchema` defined, we can now use it within the `movieSchema` as follows:

```js
const movieSchema = new Schema({
  ...
  nowShowing: { type: Boolean, default: false },
  // reviews is an array of review subdocs!
  reviews: [reviewSchema]
}, {
  timestamps: true
});
```

## 6. Creating Reviews

Here's the User Story:

_**AAU, when viewing the detail page for a movie, I want to see a form for adding a new review**_

Since we will be displaying the form for creating a new review on each movie's detail page (**show.ejs**), we won't need to implement `new` functionality for the reviews resource, thus:

- No route in `routes/reviews.js` for showing a page with a form.
- No `new` controller action in `controllers/reviews.js`
- No `views/reviews/new.ejs` template. In fact, in mongoose-movies, there's no need to even create a `views/reviews` folder.

Cool, so there's no `new` functionality code for reviews, but we certainly need to implement the `create` functionality.

Let's get coding!

### Step 1 - Determine the Proper Route

Routing for a related/nested resource can be a bit different because, in some cases, we need to "inform" the server of the nested resource's parent resource.

Let's review the [Routing for Nested Resources section of our Routing Guide](https://gist.github.com/jim-clark/17908763db7bd3c403e6#routing-for-nested-resources-onemany--manymany-relationships).

Using the chart, we find that the proper route for creating a review is:

```
POST /movies/:id/reviews
```

Note how the path of the route will provide the server with the `_id` of the movie that the review is being created for!

### Step 2 - Create the UI that Sends the Request

<details>
<summary>
‚ùì What UI did we use to create a To Do?
</summary>
<hr>

**A `<form>` element**

<hr>
</details>

Cool, so let's add the form to **movies/show.ejs** right under the current `</section>` tag:

```html
</section>
<!-- new markup below -->
<br><br><h2>Reviews</h2>
<form id="add-review-form" method="POST"
  action="/movies/<%= movie._id %>/reviews">
  <label>Review:</label>
  <textarea name="content"></textarea>
  <label>Rating:</label>
  <select name="rating">
    <option value="1">1</option>
    <option value="2">2</option>
    <option value="3">3</option>
    <option value="4">4</option>
    <option value="5" selected>5</option>
  </select>
  <input type="submit" value="Add Review">
</form>
```

Nothing new above, but be sure to review how the value for the `action` is being written.  

A touch of styling. **Update** this existing CSS rule on line 69 of **public/stylesheets/style.css**:

```css
#new-form *, #add-review-form * {
  ...
}
```

and **add** this new CSS to the bottom:

```css
#add-review-form {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: auto auto;
  gap: 1rem;
}

#add-review-form input[type="submit"] {
  width: 8rem;
  grid-column: 2 / 3;
  margin-bottom: 2rem;
}
```

Browse to the "details" of a movie.

Yeah, not exactly gorgeous but the form's `action` attribute looks pretty sweet!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/2ntk5sA.png">

### Step 3 - Define the Route on the Server

As a best practice, let's create a dedicated router module for the reviews resource:

```
touch routes/reviews.js
```

and start with the typical router boilerplate:

```js
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
// You Do - Require the yet to be created reviews controller 


// You Do - Define the Route below


module.exports = router;
```

**üëâ You Do - Finish the Router Code Above <small>(1 min)</small>** 

1. Require the reviews controller (yet to be created).

2. Define the route we just identified for creating a review.

<hr>

Now let's require the new router in **server.js**:

```js
const moviesRouter = require('./routes/movies');
// new reviews router
const reviewsRouter = require('./routes/reviews');
```

Before we mount the new router in **server.js**, let's take another look at the paths in [Routing for Nested Resources section of our Routing Guide](https://gist.github.com/jim-clark/17908763db7bd3c403e6#routing-for-nested-resources-onemany--manymany-relationships).

Notice how some paths need to start with the parent resource (`posts`) and others with the nested resource `comments`?

Because the "starts with" path varies, we won't be able to mount the reviews router in **server.js** to any particular path.

Instead, to achieve the flexibility we need, we have to mount to a starts with path of `/`:

```js
app.use('/movies', moviesRouter);
// Mount the reviews router to root because not all 
// paths for a nested resource begin the same
app.use('/', reviewsRouter);
```

As you know, the server won't be happy until we create and export that `create` action from the controller...

### Step 4 - Create and Code the Controller Action

Let's create the controller module:

```
touch controllers/reviews.js
```

Open the new **controllers/reviews.js** and let the coding commence:

```js
const Movie = require('../models/movie');

module.exports = {
  create
};
```
	
Note that although we don't have a `Review` model thanks to using embedding, we will certainly need to require the `Movie` model because we will need it to read and update the movie document that we're adding a review to.

Let's write the `create` function:
	
```js
async function create(req, res) {
  const movie = await Movie.findById(req.params.id);
  // We can push (or unshift) subdocs into Mongoose arrays
  movie.reviews.push(req.body);
  try {
    // Save any changes made to the movie doc
    await movie.save();
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err);
  }
  // Step 5:  Respond to the Request (redirect if data has been changed)
  res.redirect(`/movies/${movie._id}`);
}
```

Yes, we simply push in an object that's compatible with the embedded document's schema, call `save` on the parent doc, and redirect to wherever makes sense for the app.

Before we start adding reviews, let's update the **show.ejs** template to render a movie's reviews...

<details>
<summary>
üëÄ Do you need to sync your code?
</summary>
<hr>

**`git reset --hard origin/sync-9-create-review`**

<hr>
</details>

## 7. Displaying Reviews

Here's the User Story:

_**AAU, when viewing the detail page for a movie, I want to see a list of the movie's reviews**_

### Displaying a Movie's Reviews

All that's left is to update **movies/show.ejs** to render the movie's reviews.

The only thing new below is the use of a `if..else` to render differently if there's no reviews yet.

Let's stub up that `if..else` so that we get some practice using EJS:

```html
<!-- views/movies/show.ejs -->

...

</form>

<!-- New markup below -->

<% if (movie.reviews.length) { %>

<% } else { %>

<% } %>
```

There's nothing new between the `if..else`, so let's copy/paste it:

```html
</form>

<!-- New markup below -->

<% if (movie.reviews.length) { %>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Date</th>
        <th>Review</th>
        <th>Rating</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <% movie.reviews.forEach(function(r) { %>
        <tr>
          <!-- .toLocaleDateString() provides a more friendly date format -->
          <td><%= r.createdAt.toLocaleDateString() %></td>
          <td><%= r.content %></td>
          <td><%= r.rating %></td>
        </tr>
      <% }); %>
    </tbody>
  </table>
<% } else { %>
  <h5>No Reviews Yet</h5>
<% } %>
```

Note how we access the reviews array using `movie.reviews`.

### Try Adding Reviews!

Assuming no typos, you should be able to add reviews - congrats!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/WC9oQVf.png">

Let's wrap up with some essential questions before you start on the lab to practice this stuff!

Also, don't forget to check out the<br>_Further Study_ section which shows you how to:

- Retrieve a subdocument embedded in a Mongoose array
- Remove a subdocument from a Mongoose array, and
- Query for a document that contains a certain subdocument!

## 8. ‚ùì Essential Questions

<details>
<summary>
(1) True or False: All schemas must be compiled into a Model.
</summary>
<hr>

**False**.  We just used `reviewSchema` for the purpose of embedding reviews, however, we never compiled it into a model.

<hr>
</details>

<details>
<summary>
(2) Is it more efficient to embed or reference related data?
</summary>
<hr>

**Embed** because we can retrieve a document and its related data in a single query.

<hr>
</details>

<details>
<summary>
(3) True or False: An embedded subdocument must have its <code>save()</code> method called to be persisted to the database.
</summary>
<hr>

**False**.  Tricky question because embedded subdocs are saved when the top-level document they are embedded within is saved.

<hr>
</details>

## 9. Further Study

#### Retrieve a Subdocument from a Mongoose Array

Mongoose arrays have an `id()` method used to find a subdocument based on the subdoc's `_id`:

```js
// Assume reviewId is an ObjectId or its string representation
const reviewDoc = movieDoc.reviews.id(reviewId);
```

> Note that `reviewId` would represent the `_id` of the embedded _review_ subdoc, not the _movie_ doc.

#### Remove a Subdocument from a Mongoose Array

Mongoose arrays have a `remove()` method that can be used to remove subdocuments by their `_id`:

```js
movieDoc.reviews.remove(reviewId);
```

Subdocuments themselves use their `deleteOne()` method to remove them from the array:

```js
// Remove the embedded review subdoc that has an `_id` equal to `reviewId`
movieDoc.reviews.id(reviewId).deleteOne();
// Don't forget to save `movieDoc` to persist the deletion!
```

#### Query for a Document that Contains a Certain Subdocument

There's an amazing syntax that you can use to query documents based upon the properties of subdocs.

```js
// Find the movie that contains a certain review
const movie = await Movie.findOne({ 'reviews._id': req.params.reviewId });
  // Wow, `movie` will be the doc that contains the review with an `_id`
  // that equals that of the `req.params.reviewId` route parameter!
```

> Note that the **dot property syntax** must be enclosed in quotes.

For another example, let's say you wanted to find all movies with at least one review with a 5 rating:

```js
const highlyRatedMovies = await Movie.find({ 'reviews.rating': 5 });
console.log('Great Movies:', highlyRatedMovies);  // wow!
```

`reviews.rating` represents the `rating` property on the subdocs withing the `reviews` array!
