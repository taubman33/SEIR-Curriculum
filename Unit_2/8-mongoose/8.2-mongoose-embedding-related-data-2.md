## 6. Creating Reviews

Here's the User Story:

_**AAU, when viewing the detail page for a movie, I want to see a form for adding a new review**_

Since we will be displaying the form for creating a new review on each movie's detail page (**show.ejs**), we won't need to implement `new` functionality for the reviews resource, thus:

- No route in `routes/reviews.js` for showing a page with a form.
- No `new` controller action in `controllers/reviews.js`
- No `views/reviews/new.ejs` template. In fact, in mongoose-movies, there's no need to even create a `views/reviews` folder.

Cool, so there's no `new` functionality code for reviews, but we certainly need to implement the `create` functionality.

Let's get coding!

### Step 1 - Determine the Proper Route

Routing for a related/nested resource can be a bit different because, in some cases, we need to "inform" the server of the nested resource's parent resource.

Let's review the [Routing for Nested Resources section of our Routing Guide](https://gist.github.com/jim-clark/17908763db7bd3c403e6#routing-for-nested-resources-onemany--manymany-relationships).

Using the chart, we find that the proper route for creating a review is:

```
POST /movies/:id/reviews
```

Note how the path of the route will provide the server with the `_id` of the movie that the review is being created for!

### Step 2 - Create the UI that Sends the Request

<details>
<summary>

A <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> element

<hr>
</details>

Cool, so let's add the form to **movies/show.ejs** right under the current `</section>` tag:

```html
</section>
<!-- new markup below -->
<br><br><h2>Reviews</h2>
<form id="add-review-form" method="POST"
  action="/movies/<%= movie._id %>/reviews">
  <label>Review:</label>
  <textarea name="content"></textarea>
  <label>Rating:</label>
  <select name="rating">
    <option value="1">1</option>
    <option value="2">2</option>
    <option value="3">3</option>
    <option value="4">4</option>
    <option value="5" selected>5</option>
  </select>
  <input type="submit" value="Add Review">
</form>
```

Nothing new above, but be sure to review how the value for the `action` is being written.  

A touch of styling. **Update** this existing CSS rule on line 69 of **public/stylesheets/style.css**:

```css
#new-form *, #add-review-form * {
  ...
}
```

and **add** this new CSS to the bottom:

```css
#add-review-form {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: auto auto;
  gap: 1rem;
}

#add-review-form input[type="submit"] {
  width: 8rem;
  grid-column: 2 / 3;
  margin-bottom: 2rem;
}
```

Browse to the "details" of a movie.

Yeah, not exactly gorgeous but the form's `action` attribute looks pretty sweet!

### Step 3 - Define the Route on the Server

As a best practice, let's create a dedicated router module for the reviews resource:

```
touch routes/reviews.js
```

and start with the typical router boilerplate:

```js
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
// You Do - Require the yet to be created reviews controller 


// You Do - Define the Route below


module.exports = router;
```

**üëâ You Do - Finish the Router Code Above <small>(1 min)</small>** 

1. Require the reviews controller (yet to be created).

2. Define the route we just identified for creating a review.

<hr>

Now let's require the new router in **server.js**:

```js
const moviesRouter = require('./routes/movies');
// new reviews router
const reviewsRouter = require('./routes/reviews');
```

Before we mount the new router in **server.js**, let's take another look at the paths in [Routing for Nested Resources section of our Routing Guide](https://gist.github.com/jim-clark/17908763db7bd3c403e6#routing-for-nested-resources-onemany--manymany-relationships).

Notice how some paths need to start with the parent resource (`posts`) and others with the nested resource `comments`?

Because the "starts with" path varies, we won't be able to mount the reviews router in **server.js** to any particular path.

Instead, to achieve the flexibility we need, we have to mount to a starts with path of `/`:

```js
app.use('/movies', moviesRouter);
// Mount the reviews router to root because not all 
// paths for a nested resource begin the same
app.use('/', reviewsRouter);
```

As you know, the server won't be happy until we create and export that `create` action from the controller...

### Step 4 - Create and Code the Controller Action

Let's create the controller module:

```
touch controllers/reviews.js
```

Open the new **controllers/reviews.js** and let the coding commence:

```js
const Movie = require('../models/movie');

module.exports = {
  create
};
```
	
Note that although we don't have a `Review` model thanks to using embedding, we will certainly need to require the `Movie` model because we will need it to read and update the movie document that we're adding a review to.

Let's write the `create` function:
	
```js
async function create(req, res) {
  const movie = await Movie.findById(req.params.id);
  // We can push (or unshift) subdocs into Mongoose arrays
  movie.reviews.push(req.body);
  try {
    // Save any changes made to the movie doc
    await movie.save();
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err);
  }
  // Step 5:  Respond to the Request (redirect if data has been changed)
  res.redirect(`/movies/${movie._id}`);
}
```

Yes, we simply push in an object that's compatible with the embedded document's schema, call `save` on the parent doc, and redirect to wherever makes sense for the app.

Before we start adding reviews, let's update the **show.ejs** template to render a movie's reviews...
