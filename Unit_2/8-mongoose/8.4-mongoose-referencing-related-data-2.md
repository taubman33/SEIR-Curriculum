## 5. The `mongoose-movies` Data Model

We are going to implement the following data relationship:

**`Movie >--< Performer`** (Many-To-Many)<br>
**_A Movie has many Performers; A Performer has many Movies_**

However, unlike we saw with _Reviews_ (One-To-Many), multiple Movies can reference the same Performer creating a Many-To-Many relationship.  Here's a simplified example:

### Entity-Relationship-Diagram (ERD)

As part of the planning for your future projects, you'll need to plan the data model and document it with an Entity-Relationship-Diagram (ERD).

Here's an ERD that documents the final data model for mongoose-movies:

## 6. Referencing _Performers_ in the _Movie_ Model

Let's update the `cast` property in the `Movie` model (**models/movie.js**) to hold the `ObjectId`s of performer documents:

```js
reviews: [reviewSchema],
// Refactor from [String]
cast: [{
  type: Schema.Types.ObjectId,
  ref: 'Performer'
}],
```

The property type of `ObjectId` (or an array of `ObjectId`s) **is always** used to implement **referencing**.

The `ref: 'Performer'` informs the unicorn of Mongoose methods, [populate()](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/populate.html), which model's documents to use to replace the `ObjectId`s with. 

### Contrasting One-to-Many (1:M) and Many-to-Many (M:M) Relationships

The key difference between a `1:M` and a `M:M` relationship:

- In a `1:M` relationship, each of the **many** (child) documents belongs to only **one** (parent) document. Each time we want add a new relationship - **the child document must be created**.
- In a `M:M` relationship, **existing** documents are referenced and the same document can be referenced over and over. New documents are created only if it's the first of its kind. 

### Many:Many CRUD

So, before a many-to-many relationship can be created between two documents (often called an **association**), those two documents must first exist.

This requires that the app first provide the functionality to create the two resources independent of each other.

Then, creating the association is a matter of adding the `ObjectId` to an array on the other side of the relationship.

The array property can be on either side (even both, but that's not usually recommended).  Usually, the app's functionality reveals which side makes more sense.  For example, the viewing of a movie with its performers is slightly easier to code by putting the `cast` array on the `Movie` Model vs. a `movies` array on the `Performer` Model.

<details>
<summary>
(1) What property type is used in schemas to reference other documents?

<hr>


<code>ObjectId</code>

<summary>
(2) True or False:  Assuming the <code>Movie >---< Performer</code> relationship, when associating a "performer" document with a "movie" document, both documents must already exist in the database.

True

## 7. Associating Movies and Performers

Now that we've refactored the `cast` property in `movieSchema`, we're ready to implement the M:M relationship between _movies_ and _performers_.

But first, a quick refactor...

### üëâ You Do - Redirect to Movie `show` Functionality <small>(1 min)</small>

Currently, when a new movie is created the user is being redirected to the movies' `index` functionality...

Refactoring the redirect is done! Now for some fun!

### _AAU, when viewing a movie's detail page, I want to see a list of the cast's performers' name and birth date_

Thinking about what it's going to take to implement the above user story, answer the following questions...

<details>
<summary>
‚ùì Do movie documents have a <code>cast</code> array?
</summary>
<hr>

Yes

<hr>
</details>

<details>
<summary>
‚ùì Currently, will the movie document being passed to <strong>show.ejs</strong> contain the performers' names and birth dates in the <code>cast</code> array?
</summary>
<hr>

<strong>No</strong> it will contain only the <code>ObjectId</code> of the related performers' documents.

<hr>
</details>

<details>
<summary>
‚ùì What's the name of the Mongoose method used replace the ObjectIds with the performers' documents?
</summary>
<hr>

<code>populate()</code>, the unicorn of Mongoose üòÄ

<hr>
</details>

#### Using `populate()` to Replace `ObjectId`s with the Actual Performer Docs

Let's refactor the `moviesCtrl.show` action so that the movie will have its _performer_ documents populated in its `cast` array instead of `ObjectId`s:

```js
// controllers/movies.js

async function show(req, res) {
  // Populate the cast array with performer docs instead of ObjectIds
  const movie = await Movie.findById(req.params.id).populate('cast');
  res.render('movies/show', { title: 'Movie Detail', movie });
}
```

We can populate documents by chaining the `populate` method after any query - even nested `ObjectId`s can be populated.

<details>
<summary>
‚ùì How does the <code>populate()</code> method know which model's documents to use to replace the ObjectIds with?
</summary>
<hr>

<p>The <code>ref</code> property in the schema, for example:</p>

<pre>
cast: [{
  type: Schema.Types.ObjectId,
  ref: 'Performer'
}]
</pre>

<hr>
</details>

#### Update `movies/show.ejs` to Render the Cast

There are comments to help us find the proper place to refactor **show.ejs**.

It's a great opportunity to use the `map()` method and then join transformed array's strings.

We'll review the code while we type:

```html
<!-- movies/show.ejs -->

  <div><%= movie.nowShowing ? 'Yes' : 'Nope' %></div>
  <!-- start cast list -->
  <div>Cast:</div>
  <ul>
    <%- movie.cast.map(p => 
      `<li>${p.name} <small>${p.born.toLocaleDateString()}</small></li>`
    ).join('') %>
  </ul>
  <!-- end cast list -->
</section>
```

> üëÄ The raw output EJS tag (`<%-`) avoids the HTML tags from being escaped resulting in them displaying as text.

Cool, but we're not going to be able to see it in action until we implement the next user story...
