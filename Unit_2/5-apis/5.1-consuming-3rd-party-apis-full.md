## 1. What Kind of API are we Talking About?

The term _API_ is quite vague and used within several contexts.

First, it's an acronym that stands for **Application Programming Interface**.

_Application Programming Interfaces_ define the set of methods and properties made available by a library, a framework, an operating system, or any piece of software that programmers can use to access the software's functionality. 

However, in today's lesson we're interested in external (third-party) APIs that respond with data when we send them requests.  

## 2. Why Consume Third-Party APIs?

Lots of useful data is available via APIs across the Internet - often free of charge!

Apps we create can consume this data in interesting ways!

## 3. üëâ You Do - Research Available APIs (2 minutes)

[This GitHub repo](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis) maintains a list of well organized Public APIs.

Pick one that's interesting to you and identify the following:

- The name of the API
- What kind of data it makes available
- It's access requirements and limitations:
  - Is it completely free, free up to a certain usage, or paid from the start?
  - Does it require authentication (usually via a token)?

## 4. I Have a Simple Request

It only takes a simple `GET` request to one of the API's available endpoints to retrieve data.

Since we can issue `GET` requests straight from the browser's address bar, let's retrieve all the data you'd ever want to know about Bulbasaur:

```
https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/1
```

<details>
<summary>
‚ùì What data format was returned?
</summary>
<hr>

**JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)**, the same format as, for example, a `package.json` file.

<hr>
</details>

## 5. Different Architectural Approaches

When accessing APIs, there are a few different architectural approaches we can take:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Hflu0K0.png">

- The top-approach is the recommended approach with traditional web apps that respond to client requests with a new HTML page.  Access tokens remain secure on the server.

- The middle-approach is recommended for single-page apps (SPAs) like the MERN-stack apps we'll develop in unit 4.

- The bottom-approach is not recommended because access tokens would have to be sent to the browser.  Because of this, many APIs will disallow this architecture by not implementing [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) (discussed in a later lesson) and the request will fail.

Since we will be developing traditional web apps in this and next unit, we'll use the **top-approach** in this lesson.

## 6. Preview the Completed App

Allow me to demo what we'll be building today.

The app we'll build today consumes the [GitHub API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest) and displays repos for the entered GH Username.

If one of the repos is clicked, that repo is opened in a new browser tab.

The app has a single view (`index.ejs`).

## 7. Setup

Once again, we'll be using an Express app scaffolded by Express Generator.

1. In Terminal, move into your **~/code** folder:
    ```
    cd ~/code
    ```
2. Clone the code-along repo:
    ```
    git clone https://git.generalassemb.ly/sei-blended-learning/github-users.git
    ```
3. Move into the newly created **github-users** folder:
    ```
    cd github-users
    ```
4. Install the Node modules:
    ```
    npm i
    ```
5. Open in VS Code:
    ```
    code .
    ```

As you can see, the usual renaming of `app.js` to `server.js` has been done, but that's pretty much it.

## 8. Code the `index.ejs`

We're going to use the existing `index.ejs`.

However we want to:

- Adjust the existing boilerplate.
- Add the form for submitting GitHub usernames

Later, when we see what data comes back from the API, we'll know how to better render it. 

### Adjust the boilerplate

Let's adjust the existing **views/index.ejs** as follows:

```html
<head>
  <title>GitHub Users</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-BVYiiSIFeK1dGmJRAkycuHAHRg32OmUcww7on3RYdg4Va+PmSTsz/K68vbdEjh4u" crossorigin="anonymous">
  <link rel='stylesheet' href='/stylesheets/style.css' />
</head>
<body class="container">
  <h1 class="jumbotron text-center">GitHub Users</h1>
    
</body>
```

We've added the [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/) CSS framework to make our page look better just by using some of its pre-defined classes such as `jumbotron`.

> üëÄ Note that there are newer versions of Bootstrap available, but the concept of using a CSS framework remains the same.  In the next unit, we'll learn to use Google's Materialize CSS framework.

Next, we need a form to submit a GitHub username to retrieve repos for:

```html
<h1 class="jumbotron text-center">GitHub Users</h1>
<!-- new html below -->
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-xs-6 col-xs-offset-6">
    <form action="/" method="GET">
      <div class="input-group">
        <input type="text" name="username" class="form-control"
          placeholder="Enter a GitHub Username">
        <span class="input-group-btn">
          <button class="btn btn-success" type="submit">Go!</button>
        </span>
      </div>
    </form>
  </div>
</div>	
```

Note that we're using a `GET` method instead of `POST` in the `<form>`.

The rule of thumb is - if you're not changing data on the server, such as using the form to perform a search, use a `GET` instead of `POST`.

However, we access data submitted to the server differently when `GET` is used...

## 9. Accessing the Submitted GitHub Username

When using a `GET` in a form, the input data is sent to the server using a query string in the URL.

The [Express docs](https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#req.query) show that we access the inputs via the `req.query` object.

Like `req.params`, `req.query` is available without having to mount any middleware.

Let's take a baby step by logging out to the server terminal what was typed in the input.  In **routes/index.js**:

```js
router.get('/', function(req, res, next) {
  const username = req.query.username;
  console.log(`username: ${username}`);
  res.render('index');
});
```

Cool!  Now let's see how we're going to be able to make HTTP requests from the server...

## 10. Making HTTP Requests Using `fetch()`

Okay, so we need to make HTTP requests from the Express back-end and the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) is an awesome way to do it...

### Checking if Node already has `fetch()`

Version 18+ of Node includes the [fetch()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch) method that mimics `fetch()` that has been available in browsers for quite some time.

To check if `fetch()` is available natively, try this:

1. Open Terminal
2. Type `node` to open a Node REPL
3. Type `fetch` and press `[enter]`

If you don't see an error and see something like the following, you're good to go!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/VwzsmZK.png">

### If Necessary, Install & `require` `node-fetch`

If your version of Node does not yet have `fetch()`, not to worry because you can install and require an NPM module named [node-fetch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-fetch) that works exactly the same as the built-in version.

> üëÄ Important: We need to be sure to install `node-fetch` version 2 because version 3 mandates ES Module syntax which Node cannot use without some additional configuration at this time.

```
npm install node-fetch@2
```

> node-fetch@2 will result is the latest version of the major version 2 being installed (which will be version 2.6.7).

Now lets require it in **routes/index.js**:

```js
var express = require('express');
var router = express.Router();

// Only do the following if fetch is not
// included in Node already and you installed
// node-fetch version 2
const fetch = require('node-fetch');
```

Now, let's review the GitHub API...

## 11. The GitHub API's Endpoints

The GitHub API allows developers to view and manage repos.

Always be sure to thoroughly investigate any API that you may be considering consuming for a project.

This includes reading the documentation - poorly written documentation is a clear warning sign that you might not want to use that API.

### The Root Endpoint for the GitHub API 

The **root endpoint** is the first part of an API's URL that remains fixed.

Paths are then appended to the root endpoint to form other endpoints for specific requests.

According to the docs for the [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/), its root endpoint is:

```
https://api.github.com
```

### The _user_ and _user repositories_ Endpoints

Discovering the available endpoints of the GitHub API is easy thanks to the way GitHub has designed its root endpoint to return the available endpoints when browsed to.

Use the browser to make a `GET` request using the root endpoint of `https://api.github.com`.

Scrolling down toward the bottom will reveal a couple of endpoints that we are going to use - so let's take note of them:

- **`user_url`**: This endpoint returns some info about a user, such as a link to their avatar
- **`user_repositories_url`**: This endpoint returns an array of repositories the user is involved with.

> This "self-discovery" is a great feature of the GitHub API, we won't always be so lucky.

## 12. Access Tokens

It's not unusual for APIs to require a token be submitted with the HTTP request to access some or all of its endpoints.

According to their docs, GitHub limits anonymous users' requests to only 60 per hour, tracked by IP address.

So let's obtain an access token so that we can make up to 5,000 requests/hr and learn the proper way to provide the token to the API.

### Obtaining an Access Token

According to the docs, we can obtain personal use tokens directly from our personal GitHub accounts:

- Make sure you are logged in to your personal GitHub account and go to _settings_, then click _Developer settings_ on the left.
- Now select _Personal access tokens_ from the menu at the bottom-left.
- Click the _Generate new token_ button.
- Enter a description and click the _Generate token_ button at the bottom. There is no need to select any of the scopes listed.
- Copy your token to a temporary holding place.

### Protecting Access Tokens & other "secrets"

You've already learned that it's extremely important that we don't expose tokens, keys, database connection strings, or other secrets in our source code (or send them to the browser).

You've also learned how to use a `.env` file that stores `key=value` pairs that are merged into the system's environment variables.

For this new project we'll need to install the module that will process the `.env` file

```
npm i dotenv
```
	
Then add this code near the top of **server.js**:

```js
var logger = require('morgan');
// load secrets from .env file
require('dotenv').config();
``` 

Next, create a `.env` file and add a variable for your token:

```
GITHUB_TOKEN=1a1596cfe4484ff...
```

No spaces please!

The name of the key is up to you, but uppercase with underscores between words is the standard convention.

Now we can access the token in any module like this:

```js
// routes/index.js

// Uncomment the next line if fetch not in Node
// const fetch = require('node-fetch');

// Add the following line of code
const token = process.env.GITHUB_TOKEN;
```

## 13. Fetching Data from the GitHub API

As you saw in the demo, when we submit a GitHub username, we want the app to display the user's:

-  GitHub username
-  Their avatar
-  A list of their repos (as hyperlinks that open the repo home pages in new tab)
	
Earlier we discovered the `user_url` endpoint that returns general info for a username along with other endpoints that drill into that user's other resources.

The `user_url` endpoint was documented as `https://api.github.com/users/{user}`.

For the GitHub API, any segment that has curly braces, such as `{user}` shown above, is a placeholder where we need to provide an actual value - in this case, a GitHub username.

Next, let's define a variable to hold the root endpoint in **routes/index.js**:

```js
// routes/index.js

...

const token = process.env.token;

// Add the line below
const ROOT_URL = 'https://api.github.com';
```

### First Attempt to Call the API

First, don't worry about trying to learn too much about `fetch()` in this lesson - we'll have plenty more about how to use `fetch()` when we learn about the MERN-Stack.

Now let's use `fetch()` to send a `GET` request to the `user_url` endpoint for the submitted username and render the entire JSON response - be sure to read the comments to understand help how `fetch()` works:

```js
// routes/index.js

...

router.get('/', function(req, res, next) {
  // Use Express's req.query object to 
  // access query parameters
  const username = req.query.username;
  // If this is not a "search",
  // just render the index view
  if (!username) return res.render('index', {userData: null});
  // Temporarily, we'll pass the token
  // in a querystring
  fetch(`${ROOT_URL}/users/${username}?access_token=${token}`)
    // fetch() returned a promise that 
    // resolves to a response object
    .then(res => res.json())
    // To access the data received from the API,
    // we've called the response object's
    // .json() method which resolves to the data...
    .then(userData => {
      res.render('index', { userData });
    });
});
```

> We'll ignore the best practice of creating a separate controller module - let's be rebels this lesson!

Since we're passing the data returned from the API to our **index.ejs**.  Let's display it:

```html
  <!-- new HTML just above closing body tag -->
  <hr>
  <div class="row col-xs-8 col-xs-offset-2">
    <% if (userData) { %>
      <!-- If we don't stringify the data, we'll just see [object Object] - see Further Study section -->
      <%= JSON.stringify(userData) %>
    <% } else { %>
      <h3 class="text-center text-info">
        Submit a GitHub username!
      </h3>
    <% } %>
  </div>
</body>
```

Make sure nodemon is running and try submitting your GitHub username.

We're on our way!

### Refactor to Send the Token in a Header Instead

The `fetch` function accepts an optional **options** object that enables us to:

- Specify any HTTP method (fetch defaults to a `GET`)
- Add headers to the HTTP request
- Send data in the body of the request

Let's refactor the code to pass the token in a header instead of a query string which is a better practice...

Here's the refactored code:

```js
router.get('/', function(req, res, next) {
  const username = req.query.username;
  if (!username) return res.render('index', {userData: null});
  // Define an object that will also come in handy later
  const options = {
    headers: {
      Authorization: `token ${token}`
    }
  };
  // Next line has been refactored
  fetch(`${ROOT_URL}/users/${username}`, options)
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(userData => {
      res.render('index', { userData });
    });
});
```

### Examining the Returned Data

Examining the data we'll see that:

- The `login` property holds the username, and
- The `avatar_url` property points to user's avatar image

So now we can update the view a bit to render the username and display the avatar using a Bootstrap **panel**:

```html
<% if (userData) { %>
  <!-- Start of updated markup -->
  <div class="panel panel-default">
    <div class="panel-heading text-center">
      <img src="<%= userData.avatar_url %>"
        class="img-circle" width="300">
      <h2><%= userData.login %></h2>
    </div>
    <div class="panel-body">
      <h3>Repos:</h3>
      need to list repos here...
    </div>
  </div>
  <!-- End of updated markup -->
<% } else { %>
```

### Looking good!

Not looking too bad.  Now we just need to list the user's repositories.

Time to make a second request for the details...

## 14. Details, I Want Details!

When consuming APIs, it may be necessary to make multiple requests to different endpoints to fetch all of the data you need before rendering.

Multiple requests can be chained as follows:

```js
// routes/index.js

...

router.get('/', function(req, res, next) {

fetch(`${ROOT_URL}/users/${username}`, options)
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(userData => {
    // return the promise to be handled by the next .then
    return fetch(userData.repos_url, options);
  })
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(repos => {
    // let's see what properties a repo has...
    console.log(repos[0]);
    // Houston, we have a problem!
    res.render('index', { userData });
  });
```

We have a scope issue because `userData` is not in scope in that last function!

A solution would be to define the `userData` variable above & outside of those fetch callback functions.

Or, we can use perhaps the coolest thing to land in JavaScript in quite some time - [async/await](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous/Async_await).

Let's do our best to refactor the code, trust me, it will be worth it!

```js
// routes/index.js

...

// To use await in a function, the function
// needs to be declared as async
router.get('/', async function(req, res, next) {
  
  ...
  
  // await results in the resolved value being returned!
  // The res.json() promise is what's being awaited 
  const userData = await fetch(`${ROOT_URL}/users/${username}`, options)
    .then(res => res.json());
  // Fetching the the user's repo data
  userData.repos = await fetch(userData.repos_url, options)
    .then(res => res.json());
  // Let's check the first repo to see what properties it has...
  console.log(userData.repos[0]);
  res.render('index', { userData });
}
```

That should do the trick!

### Rendering the Repos

Okay, we're logging out the first repo in the array so that we could see what properties are in there - and there's a bunch!

However, this app only needs the `name` and the `html_url` properties.

Bootstrap has a nice **List Group** component that's great for listing links:

```html
<div class="panel-body">
  <h3>Repos:</h3>
  <!-- New markup below -->
  <div class="list-group">
    <% userData.repos.forEach(function(repo) { %>
      <a href="<%= repo.html_url %>" target="_blank"
        class="list-group-item">
        <%= repo.name %>
      </a>
    <% }); %>
  </div>
  <!-- New markup above -->
</div>
```

## 16. Further Study

[JSON.parse()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse) converts a string into a JS Object and [JSON.stringify()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify) does just the opposite by converting a JS object into a JSON string.
