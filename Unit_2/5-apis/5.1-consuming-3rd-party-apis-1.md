## 1. What Kind of API are we Talking About?

The term _API_ is quite vague and used within several contexts.

First, it's an acronym that stands for **Application Programming Interface**.

_Application Programming Interfaces_ define the set of methods and properties made available by a library, a framework, an operating system, or any piece of software that programmers can use to access the software's functionality. 

However, in today's lesson we're interested in external (third-party) APIs that respond with data when we send them requests.  

## 2. Why Consume Third-Party APIs?

Lots of useful data is available via APIs across the Internet - often free of charge!

Apps we create can consume this data in interesting ways!

## 3. üëâ You Do - Research Available APIs (2 minutes)

[This GitHub repo](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis) maintains a list of well organized Public APIs.

Pick one that's interesting to you and identify the following:

- The name of the API
- What kind of data it makes available
- It's access requirements and limitations:
  - Is it completely free, free up to a certain usage, or paid from the start?
  - Does it require authentication (usually via a token)?

## 4. I Have a Simple Request

It only takes a simple `GET` request to one of the API's available endpoints to retrieve data.

Since we can issue `GET` requests straight from the browser's address bar, let's retrieve all the data you'd ever want to know about Bulbasaur:

```

```

**JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)**, the same format as, for example, a `package.json` file.

## 5. Different Architectural Approaches

When accessing APIs, there are a few different architectural approaches we can take:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Hflu0K0.png">

- The top-approach is the recommended approach with traditional web apps that respond to client requests with a new HTML page.  Access tokens remain secure on the server.

- The middle-approach is recommended for single-page apps (SPAs) like the MERN-stack apps we'll develop in unit 4.

- The bottom-approach is not recommended because access tokens would have to be sent to the browser.  Because of this, many APIs will disallow this architecture by not implementing [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) (discussed in a later lesson) and the request will fail.

Since we will be developing traditional web apps in this and next unit, we'll use the **top-approach** in this lesson.

## 6. Preview the Completed App

Allow me to demo what we'll be building today.

The app we'll build today consumes the [GitHub API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest) and displays repos for the entered GH Username.

If one of the repos is clicked, that repo is opened in a new browser tab.

The app has a single view (`index.ejs`).

## 7. Setup

Once again, we'll be using an Express app scaffolded by Express Generator.

1. In Terminal, move into your **~/code** folder:
    ```
    cd ~/code
    ```
2. Clone the code-along repo:
    ```
    git clone https://git.generalassemb.ly/sei-blended-learning/github-users.git
    ```
3. Move into the newly created **github-users** folder:
    ```
    cd github-users
    ```
4. Install the Node modules:
    ```
    npm i
    ```
5. Open in VS Code:
    ```
    code .
    ```

As you can see, the usual renaming of `app.js` to `server.js` has been done, but that's pretty much it.

## 8. Code the `index.ejs`

We're going to use the existing `index.ejs`.

However we want to:

- Adjust the existing boilerplate.
- Add the form for submitting GitHub usernames

Later, when we see what data comes back from the API, we'll know how to better render it. 

### Adjust the boilerplate

Let's adjust the existing **views/index.ejs** as follows:

```html
<head>
  <title>GitHub Users</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-BVYiiSIFeK1dGmJRAkycuHAHRg32OmUcww7on3RYdg4Va+PmSTsz/K68vbdEjh4u" crossorigin="anonymous">
  <link rel='stylesheet' href='/stylesheets/style.css' />
</head>
<body class="container">
  <h1 class="jumbotron text-center">GitHub Users</h1>
    
</body>
```

We've added the [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/) CSS framework to make our page look better just by using some of its pre-defined classes such as `jumbotron`.

> üëÄ Note that there are newer versions of Bootstrap available, but the concept of using a CSS framework remains the same.  In the next unit, we'll learn to use Google's Materialize CSS framework.

Next, we need a form to submit a GitHub username to retrieve repos for:

```html
<h1 class="jumbotron text-center">GitHub Users</h1>
<!-- new html below -->
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-xs-6 col-xs-offset-6">
    <form action="/" method="GET">
      <div class="input-group">
        <input type="text" name="username" class="form-control"
          placeholder="Enter a GitHub Username">
        <span class="input-group-btn">
          <button class="btn btn-success" type="submit">Go!</button>
        </span>
      </div>
    </form>
  </div>
</div>	
```

Note that we're using a `GET` method instead of `POST` in the `<form>`.

The rule of thumb is - if you're not changing data on the server, such as using the form to perform a search, use a `GET` instead of `POST`.

However, we access data submitted to the server differently when `GET` is used...

## 9. Accessing the Submitted GitHub Username

When using a `GET` in a form, the input data is sent to the server using a query string in the URL.

The [Express docs](https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#req.query) show that we access the inputs via the `req.query` object.

Like `req.params`, `req.query` is available without having to mount any middleware.

Let's take a baby step by logging out to the server terminal what was typed in the input.  In **routes/index.js**:

```js
router.get('/', function(req, res, next) {
  const username = req.query.username;
  console.log(`username: ${username}`);
  res.render('index');
});
```

Cool!  Now let's see how we're going to be able to make HTTP requests from the server...
