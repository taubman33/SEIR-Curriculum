## 1. Setup

This lesson continues to build-out Cat Collector right where the _Intro to Django Models_ lesson left off.

If your Cat Collector is up and running from the last lesson, there's no reason to sync, otherwise...

<details>
<summary>
üëÄ Do you need to sync your code?
</summary>
<hr>

<code>git reset --hard origin/sync-13-one-many-starter</code>

<hr>
</details>

Then you can start the web server with `python3 manage.py runserver`

## 2. A Cat's Got to Eat!

In this lesson we're going to look at how to add another model that demonstrates working with **one-to-many** relationships in Django.

Since a cat's got to eat, let's go with this relationship:

### Add the `Feeding` Model

Using the ERD above as a guide, let's add the new `Feeding` Model (below the current `Cat` Model):

```python
# Add new Feeding model below Cat model
class Feeding(models.Model):
  date = models.DateField()
  meal = models.CharField(max_length=1)
```

Note that using a single-character to represent what meal the feeding is for:

- `B`reakfast
- `L`unch
- `D`inner...

### Field.choices

Django has a [Field.choices](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/ref/models/fields/#choices) feature that will make the single-characters more user-friendly by automatically generating a select dropdown in the form using descriptions that we define.

The first step is to define a tuple of 2-tuples.  Because we might need to access this tuple within the `Cat` class also, let's define it above both of the Model classes:

```python
# A tuple of 2-tuples
MEALS = (
    ('B', 'Breakfast'),
    ('L', 'Lunch'),
    ('D', 'Dinner')
)
# new code above

class Cat(models.Model):
``` 

As you can see, the first item in each 2-tuple represents the value that will be stored in the database, e.g. `B`.

The second item represents the human-friendly "display" value, e.g., `Breakfast`.

Now let's enhance the `meal` field as follows:

```python
class Feeding(models.Model):
  date = models.DateField()
  meal = models.CharField(
    max_length=1,
    # add the 'choices' field option
    choices=MEALS,
    # set the default value for meal to be 'B'
    default=MEALS[0][0]
  )
```

### Add the `__str__` Method

As recommended, we should override the `__str__` method on Models so that they provide more meaningful output when they are printed:


```python
class Feeding(models.Model):
  ...

  def __str__(self):
    # Nice method for obtaining the friendly value of a Field.choice
    return f"{self.get_meal_display()} on {self.date}"
```

Check out the convenient `get_meal_display()` method Django automagically creates to access the human-friendly value of a Field.choice like we have on `meal`.

### Add the Foreign Key

Since a `Feeding` **belongs to** a `Cat`, it must hold the `id` of the cat object it belongs to - yep, it needs a **foreign key**!

Here's how it's done - Django style:

```python
class Feeding(models.Model):
  date = models.DateField()
  meal = models.CharField(
    max_length=1,
	 choices=MEALS,
	 default=MEALS[0][0]
  )
  # Create a cat_id FK
  cat = models.ForeignKey(Cat, on_delete=models.CASCADE)

  def __str__(self):
    return f"{self.get_meal_display()} on {self.date}"
```

As you can see, the `ForeignKey` field-type is used to create a one-to-many relationship.

> üëÄ In the database, the column in the `feedings` table for the FK will actually be called `cat_id` because Django by default appends `_id` to the name of the attribute we use in the Model.

The first argument provides the parent Model.

In a one-to-many relationship, the `on_delete=models.CASCADE` is required.  It ensures that if a Cat record is deleted, all of the child Feedings will be deleted automatically as well - thus avoiding _orphan_ records (seriously, that's what they're called).

## 5. Make and Run the Migration

We added/updated a new Model, so it's that time again...

```
python3 manage.py makemigrations
```

<details>
<summary>
‚ùì Now what command do we need to run?
</summary>
<hr>

<pre>
python3 manage.py migrate
</pre>

<hr>
</details>

After creating a Model, especially one that relates to another, it's always a good idea to test drive the Model and relationships in the shell.

## 6. Test the Models in the Shell

Besides testing Models and their relationships, the following will demonstrate how to work with the ORM in views.

First, open the shell:

```
python3 manage.py shell
```

Now let's import everything **models.py** has to offer:

```python
>>> from main_app.models import *
>>> Feeding
<class 'main_app.models.Feeding'>
>>> MEALS
(('B', 'Breakfast'), ('L', 'Lunch'), ('D', 'Dinner'))
```

So far, so good!

### May the Test Drive Commence...

```python
# get first cat object in db
>>> c = Cat.objects.first()   # or Cat.objects.all()[0]
>>> c
<Cat: Maki>
# obtain all feeding objects for a cat using the "related manager" object
>>> c.feeding_set.all()
<QuerySet []>
# create a feeding for a given cat
>>> c.feeding_set.create(date='2022-10-06')
<Feeding: Breakfast on 2022-10-06>
# yup, it's there and the default of 'B' for the meal worked
>>> Feeding.objects.all()
<QuerySet [<Feeding: Breakfast on 2022-10-06>]>
# and it belongs to a cat
>>> c.feeding_set.all()
<QuerySet [<Feeding: Breakfast on 2022-10-06>]>
# get the first feeding object in the db
>>> f = Feeding.objects.first()
>>> f
<Feeding: Breakfast on 2022-10-06>
# cat is the name of the field we defined in the Feeding model
>>> f.cat
<Cat: Maki>
>>> f.cat.description
'Lazy but ornery & cute'
# another way to create a feeding for a cat
>>> f = Feeding(date='2022-10-06', meal='L', cat=c)
>>> f.save()
>>> f
<Feeding: Lunch on 2022-10-06>
>>> c.feeding_set.all()
<QuerySet [<Feeding: Breakfast on 2022-10-06>, <Feeding: Lunch on 2022-10-06>]>
# finish the day's feeding, this time using the create method
>>> Feeding.objects.create(date='2022-10-06', meal='D', cat=c)
>>> c.feeding_set.count()
3
# feed another cat
# (ensure a cat with id of 3 exists)
>>> c = Cat.objects.get(id=3)
>>> c
<Cat: Whiskers>
>>> c.feeding_set.create(date='2022-10-07', meal='B')
<Feeding: Breakfast on 2022-10-07>
>>> Feeding.objects.filter(meal='B')
<QuerySet [<Feeding: Breakfast on 2022-10-06>, <Feeding: Breakfast on 2022-10-07>]>
# the foreign key (cat_id) can be used as well
>>> Feeding.objects.filter(cat_id=2)
<QuerySet [<Feeding: Breakfast on 2022-10-06>, <Feeding: Lunch on 2022-10-06>, <Feeding: Dinner on 2022-10-06>]>
>>> Feeding.objects.create(date='2022-10-07', meal='L', cat_id=3)
>>> Cat.objects.get(id=3).feeding_set.all()
<QuerySet [<Feeding: Breakfast on 2022-10-07>, <Feeding: Lunch on 2022-10-07>]>
exit()
```

Behind the scenes, an enormous amount of SQL was being generated and sent to the database thanks to Django's ORM.

### üëâ You Do - Practice CRUDing Feedings (5 minutes)

Practice creating and accessing feedings for a cat...

1. Retrieve the last cat using the `Cat` model and its object manager's `last()` method and assign to a variable named `last_cat`.<br>Hint: Refer to how the `first()` method is being used to retrieve the first cat above.

2. Use the `create()` method on `last_cat`'s related manager to add a **L**unch and a **D**inner feeding for today.<br>Hint: We used this approach to create the very first feeding above.

3. Verify both feeding objects were created by calling the `all()` method on `last_cat`'s related manager.
