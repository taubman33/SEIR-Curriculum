### 👉 You Do - Practice CRUDing Feedings (5 minutes)

Practice creating and accessing feedings for a cat...

1. Retrieve the last cat using the `Cat` model and its object manager's `last()` method and assign to a variable named `last_cat`.<br>Hint: Refer to how the `first()` method is being used to retrieve the first cat above.

2. Use the `create()` method on `last_cat`'s related manager to add a **L**unch and a **D**inner feeding for today.<br>Hint: We used this approach to create the very first feeding above.

3. Verify both feeding objects were created by calling the `all()` method on `last_cat`'s related manager.

## 7. Add `Feeding` to the Admin Portal

Remember, before a Model can be CRUD'd using the built-in Django admin portal, the Model must be registered.

Update `main_app/admin.py` so that it looks as follows:

```python
from django.contrib import admin
# add Feeding to the import
from .models import Cat, Feeding

admin.site.register(Cat)
# register the new Feeding Model 
admin.site.register(Feeding)
```

Now browse to `localhost:8000/admin` and click on the `Feeding` link.

Check out those select drop-downs for assigning both the Meal and the Cat!

### Custom Field Labels

By default, the admin portal uses the attribute names as labels with the first character capitalized.  For example:  **Date**.

Perhaps you would like to override a label?

Because Django subscribes to the philosophy that **a Model is the single, definitive source of truth about your data**, you can bet that's where we will add customization.

In `main_app/models.py`, add the desired user-friendly label to the field-type like so:

```python
class Feeding(models.Model):
  # the first optional positional argument overrides the label
  date = models.DateField('feeding date')
  ...
```

Refresh and...

What's cool is that the custom labels will be used in all of Django's ModelForms too!

## 8. Displaying a Cat's Feedings

Just like it would make sense in an app to show _comments_ for a _post_ when that post is displayed, a cat's _detail_ page is where it would make sense to display a cat's feedings.

No additional views or templates necessary.  All we have to do is update the **detail.html**.

The final version of Cat Collector has a cat's feedings displayed to the right of the cat's details.  We can do this using Materialize's grid system to define layout columns.

Copy/paste the new markup in **detail.html**, then we'll review:

```html
{% extends 'base.html' %}
{% block content %}

<h1>Cat Details</h1>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col s6">
    <div class="card">
      <div class="card-content">
        <span class="card-title">{{ cat.name }}</span>
        <p>Breed: {{ cat.breed }}</p>
        <p>Description: {{ cat.description|linebreaks }}</p>
        {% if cat.age > 0 %}
          <p>Age: {{ cat.age }}</p>
        {% else %}
          <p>Age: Kitten</p>
        {% endif %}
      </div>
      <div class="card-action">
        <a href="{% url 'cats_update' cat.id %}">Edit</a>
        <a href="{% url 'cats_delete' cat.id %}">Delete</a>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <!-- New Markup Below -->
  <div class="col s6">
    <table class="striped">
      <thead>
        <tr><th>Date</th><th>Meal</th></tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        {% for feeding in cat.feeding_set.all %}
          <tr>
            <td>{{feeding.date}}</td>
            <td>{{feeding.get_meal_display}}</td>
          </tr>
        {% endfor %}
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </div>
  <!-- New Markup Above -->
</div>
{% endblock %}
```

A refresh results in this:

## 9. Adding New Feeding Functionality

Now we want to add the capability to add a new feeding when viewing a cat's details.

Previously we used class-based views to productively perform create and update data operations for a Model.

The CBV we used automatically created a `ModelForm` for the Model that was specified like this:  `model = Cat`.

The CBV then used the `ModelForm` behind the scenes to generate the inputs and provide the posted data to the server.

Because we want to be able to show a form for adding a **feeding** on the _detail_ page of a **cat**, we're going to see in this lesson how to create a custom `ModelForm` from scratch that will:

1. Generate a feeding's inputs inside of the `<form>` tag we provide.
2. Be used to validate the posted data by calling `is_valid()`.
3. Persist the model instance to the database by calling `save()` on the instance of the ModelForm.

There's several steps we're going to need to complete, so let's get started...

### Create the ModelForm for the `Feeding` Model

We could define the ModelForm inside of the **models.py** module, but we're going to follow a best practice of defining it inside of a **forms.py** module instead:

```
touch main_app/forms.py
```

Now let's define the ModelForm:

```python
# forms.py

from django.forms import ModelForm
from .models import Feeding

class FeedingForm(ModelForm):
  class Meta:
    model = Feeding
    fields = ['date', 'meal']
```

Note that our custom form inherits from `ModelForm` and has a nested `class Meta:` to declare the Model being used and the fields we want inputs generated for. Confusing? Absolutely, but it's just the way it is, so accept it and sleep well.

Many of the attributes in the `Meta` class are in common with CBVs because the CBV was using them behind the scenes to create a ModelForm as previously mentioned.

For more options, check out the [Django ModelForms documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/topics/forms/modelforms/#modelform).

### Passing an Instance of `FeedingForm`

`FeedingForm` is a class that needs to be instantiated in the `cats_detail` view function so that it can be "rendered" inside of _detail.html_.

Here's the updated `cats_detail` view function in _views.py_:

```python
from .models import Cat
# Import the FeedingForm
from .forms import FeedingForm

...

# update this view function
def cats_detail(request, cat_id):
  cat = Cat.objects.get(id=cat_id)
  # instantiate FeedingForm to be rendered in the template
  feeding_form = FeedingForm()
  return render(request, 'cats/detail.html', {
    # include the cat and feeding_form in the context
    'cat': cat, 'feeding_form': feeding_form
  })
```

`feeding_form` is set to an instance of `FeedingForm` and then it's passed to **detail.html** in the context along with `cat`.

### Displaying `FeedingForm` Inside of **detail.html**

We want to display a `<form>` at the top of the feedings column in **templates/cats/detail.html** above the feeding `<table>`.

```html
<div class="col s6">
  <!-- New Markup Below -->
  <form method="POST">
    {% csrf_token %}
    <!-- Render the inputs -->
    {{ feeding_form.as_p }}
    <input type="submit" class="btn" value="Add Feeding">
  </form>
  <!-- New Markup Above -->
  <table class="striped">
  ...
```
As always, we need to include the `{% csrf_token %}` for security purposes.

A form's `action` attribute determines the URL that a form is submitted to. For now, we'll leave it out and come back to it in a bit.

The `{{ feeding_form.as_p }}` will generate the `<input>` tags wrapped in `<p>` tags for each field we specified in `FeedingForm`.

Let's see what it looks like - not perfect but it's a start:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/KGb0FcW.png">

Unfortunately, the _Feeding Date_ field is just a basic text input. This is what Django uses by default for `DateField`s.

Also, we don't see a drop-down for the _Meal_ field as expected.  However, it's in the HTML, but it's not rendering correctly due to the use of Materialize.

### Add Materialize's JavaScript Library

Luckily we can use Materialize to solve both problems. However, solving the problems will require that we include Materialize's JavaScript library and add a bit of our own JavaScript to "initialize" the inputs.

First, update **base.html** to include the Materialize JS library:

```html
<head>
  ...
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="{% static 'style.css' %}">
  <!-- Add the following below --->
  <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/materialize/1.0.0/js/materialize.min.js"></script>
  ...
```
 
#### Using a Date-picker for _Feeding Date_

Remember that sweet Materialize date-picker? 

Materialize requires us to "initialize" certain inputs using a bit of JavaScript.

We want this JS to run after the elements are in the DOM, so we'll put the JS at the bottom of the template.

Let's add the `<script>` tags just above the `{% endblock %}` of **templates/cats/detail.html**:

```html
</div>

<!-- below all HTML -->
<script>

</script>
{% endblock %}
```

Using Materialize, it takes two steps to get the inputs the way we want them:

- Select the element(s)
- "Initialize" the element(s) using Materialize's library

Here's the JS to add inside of the `<script>` tags to initialize the date-picker:

```js
</div>

<script>
  const dateEl = document.getElementById('id_date');
  // M is Materialize's global variable
  M.Datepicker.init(dateEl, {
    format: 'yyyy-mm-dd',
    defaultDate: new Date(),
    setDefaultDate: true,
    autoClose: true
  });
</script>
{% endblock %}
```

As you can see, the `ModelForm` automatically generated an `id` attribute for each `<input>`.  Always be sure to use Devtools to figure out how to select elements for styling, etc.

There are plenty of additional options for date-pickers than the four used above.  [Materialize's date-picker documentation](https://materializecss.com/pickers.html) has the details.

Refresh and test it out by clicking inside of _Feeding Date_ - you should see a sweet date-picker pop up like this:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/eEIRrA1.png">

Now let's fix the dropdown...

#### Fix the _Meal_ `<select>`

Thanks to `choices=MEALS` in the `Feeding` model, the `FeedingForm` generated a nice `<select>` instead of the typical `<input type="text">` for a `CharField`.

But, `<select>` dropdowns also need to be initialized when using Materialize.

It doesn't require any options, just select it and init it:

```html
</div>

<script>
  const dateEl = document.getElementById('id_date');
  M.Datepicker.init(dateEl, {
    format: 'yyyy-mm-dd',
    defaultDate: new Date(),
    setDefaultDate: true,
    autoClose: true
  });

  // add additional JS to initialize select below
  const selectEl = document.getElementById('id_meal');
  M.FormSelect.init(selectEl);
</script>
{% endblock %}
```

Refresh and the _Meal_ `<select>` is looking good:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/7GKa6DB.png">

Now with the UI done, let's think about the URL to `POST` the form to...

### Add Another `path(...)` to `urls.py`

Every `Feeding` object needs a value for its `cat_id` foreign key that holds the primary key of the cat object that it belongs to.

Therefore, we need to ensure that the route includes a URL parameter for capturing the cat's `id` like we've done in other routes:

```python
# main_app/urls.py

urlpatterns = [
	...
    path('cats/<int:cat_id>/add_feeding/', views.add_feeding, name='add_feeding'),
]
```

To match the new route, the `<form>`'s `action` attribute will need to look something like `/cats/2/add_feeding`. 

Let's go there now...

### Add the `action` Attribute to the `<form>`

As always, we'll use the `url` template tag to generate the proper path for the `action` attribute:

```html
<!-- templates/cats/detail.html -->

<div class="col s6">
  <!-- add the action attribute as follows -->
  <form action="{% url 'add_feeding' cat.id %}" method="POST">
    {% csrf_token %}
    {{ feeding_form.as_p }}
    <input type="submit" class="btn" value="Add Feeding">
  </form>
```

As you know, if the URL requires values for URL parameters such as `<int:cat_id>`, the `url` template tag accepts them after the name of the route.

We won't be able to refresh and check it out until we add the `views.add_feeding` function...

### Add the `views.add_feeding` View Function to `views.py`

Let's start by stubbing up an `add_feeding` view function in **views.py** so that the server will start back up and we can inspect our `<form>`:

```python
...

# add this new function below cats_detail
def add_feeding(request, cat_id):
  # Baby step
  pass 
```

Now we can refresh and inspectthe elements using DevTools shows that our `<form>` is looking good:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ENEb2d0.png">

Now let's code the `add_feeding` view function:

```python
def add_feeding(request, cat_id):
  # create a ModelForm instance using the data in request.POST
  form = FeedingForm(request.POST)
  # validate the form
  if form.is_valid():
    # don't save the form to the db until it
    # has the cat_id assigned
    new_feeding = form.save(commit=False)
    new_feeding.cat_id = cat_id
    new_feeding.save()
  return redirect('detail', cat_id=cat_id)
```

<details>
<summary>
❓ What does <code>request.POST</code> remind you of in Express?
</summary>
<hr>

<code>req.body</code>

<hr>
</details>

After ensuring that the form contains valid data, we save the form with the `commit=False` option, which returns an in-memory model object so that we can assign the `cat_id` before actually saving to the database.

Always be sure to `redirect` instead of `render` if data has been changed in the database.

We also need to import `redirect` by adding after `render`:

```python
# main_app/views.py
from django.shortcuts import render, redirect
```

Add a feeding and rejoice!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/QP1Kfv1.png">

Well, almost...

### Ordering Feedings

It would be nice to have the most recent dates displayed at the top.

Yup, _a Model is the single, definitive source of truth..._

The answer lies in adding a `class Meta` with an `ordering` class attribute within the `Feeding` Model:

```python
class Feeding(models.Model):
  ...
  def __str__(self):
    # Nice method for obtaining the friendly value of a Field.choice
    return f"{self.get_meal_display()} on {self.date}"

  # change the default sort
  class Meta:
    ordering = ['-date']
```

Feed the cats!

## 11. Lab Assignment

As usual, the lab calls for implementing the same features in your Finch Collector project.

## 12. Bonus Challenge: Adding a Custom Method to Check the Feeding Status

When adding _business logic_ to an application, always consider adding that logic to the Models first.

This approach is referred to as "fat models / skinny views" and results in keeping code DRY.

We're going to add a custom method to the `Cat` Model that help's enable the following messaging based upon whether or not the cat has had at least the number of feedings for the current day as there are MEALS.

When a cat does not have at least the number of MEALS: 

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/3TEZ8nl.png">

And when the cat has been completely fed for the day:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/E1yCDHr.png">

### The `fed_for_today` Custom Model Method

Let's add a one line method to the `Cat` Model class:

```python
from django.db import models
from django.urls import reverse
# add this import
from datetime import date

class Cat(models.Model):
  ...
  # add this new method
  def fed_for_today(self):
    return self.feeding_set.filter(date=date.today()).count() >= len(MEALS)
```

Be sure to add the import at the top of _models.py_.

The `fed_for_today` method demonstrates the use of `filter()` to obtain a `<QuerySet>` for today's feedings, then `count()` is chained on to the query to return the actual number of objects returned.

The above approach in more efficient than this similar code:

```python
len( self.feeding_set.filter(date=date.today()) )
```
because this code would return all objects from the database when all we need is the number of objects returned by `count()`. In other words, don't return data from the database if you don't need it.

### Update the **detail.html** Template

All that's left is to sprinkle in a little template code like this:

```html
...
  <div class="col s6">
    <form action="{% url 'add_feeding' cat.id %}" method="POST">
      {% csrf_token %}
      {{ feeding_form.as_p }}
      <input type="submit" class="btn" value="Add Feeding">
    </form>
    <!-- new markup below -->
    <br>
    {% if cat.fed_for_today %}
      <div class="card-panel teal-text center-align">{{cat.name}} has been fed all meals for today</div>
    {% else %}
      <div class="card-panel red-text center-align">{{cat.name}} might be hungry</div>
    {% endif %}
    <!-- new markup above-->
    <table class="striped">

```

Congrats on using a custom Model method to implement business logic!
