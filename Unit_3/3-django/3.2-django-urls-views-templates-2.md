### ðŸ‘‰ You Do - Define another URL, View Function and Template (10 mins)

1. Define another route with a path of `about/`.  The path's trailing slash instead of a leading slash is the Django way and is critical to follow.

2. Map the route to a view named `views.about`.

3. Name the route `'about'`.

4. Code the `about` view function in **views.py** so that it renders a template named `about.html`

5. Create the **templates/about.html** file.

6. Add the boilerplate and add HTML between the `<body>` tags:

	```html
	<h1>About the Cat Collector</h1>
	<hr>
	<p>Hire the Cat Collector!</p>
	<footer>All Rights Reserved, &copy; 2022 Cat Collector</footer>
	```

7. Test it out by browsing to `localhost:8000/about`

<details>
<summary>
ðŸ‘€ Do you need to sync your code?
</summary>
<hr>

<code>git reset --hard origin/sync-3-about-page</code>

<hr>
</details>

So far, so good, but we haven't yet used any of DTL's capability to dynamically render data, etc.

But before we continue to break the DRY principle by repeating the boilerplate in future templates, let's see how to use Django's **Template Inheritance**.

## 8. Template Inheritance (Partials)

Django has a [template inheritance](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/ref/templates/language/#template-inheritance) feature built-in.

Template inheritance is like using partials in EJS with Express, except they're more flexible.

The reason Django calls it template _inheritance_ is because:

- You can declare that a template **extends** another template.
- When a template extends a "base" template, it's content defined in a "block" replaces the same "block" in the "base" template as shown below:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/D4qnlWH.jpg">

Let's apply this concept in Cat Collector by first creating a **base.html** template (named by convention):

```
touch main_app/templates/base.html
```

The "base" template contains all of the boilerplate and markup that belongs on every template that extends it, such as the `<head>`, navigation, even a footer if you wish.

> ðŸ‘€ Multiple "base" templates is rarely needed but can be defined if need be.

This will be our sweet boilerplate for now:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
  <title>Cat Collector</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/materialize/1.0.0/css/materialize.min.css">
</head>
<body>
  <header class="navbar-fixed">
    <nav>
      <div class="nav-wrapper">
        <ul>
          <li><a href="/" class="left brand-logo">&nbsp;&nbsp;Cat Collector</a></li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="right">
          <li><a href="/about">About</a></li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </nav>
  </header>
  <main class="container">
    {% block content %}
    {% endblock %}
  </main>
  <footer class="page-footer">
    <div class="right">All Rights Reserved, &copy; 2021 Cat Collector &nbsp;</div>
  </footer>
</body>
</html>
```

Cat Collector will be using the [Materialize CSS Framework](https://materializecss.com/) which is based on Google's Material Design philosophy.

However, the most important part of the boilerplate in regards to template inheritance is:

```html
{% block content %}
{% endblock %}
```

This is our first look at DTL **template tags**, `block` & `endblock`, enclosed within the template tag delimiters `{% %}`.

Django [template tags](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/ref/templates/builtins/#ref-templates-builtins-tags) control logic within a template.  Depending upon the tag, they may, or may not, result in content being emitted in the page. 

Whenever another template **extends** this **base.html**, that other template's `{% block content %}` will replace the same block in **base.html**.

To see template inheritance in action, let's update **about.html** so that it extends **base.html**:

```html
{% extends 'base.html' %}
{% block content %}

<h1>About the Cat Collector</h1>
<hr>
<p>Hire the Cat Collector!</p>
<footer>All Rights Reserved, &copy; 2022 Cat Collector</footer>

{% endblock %}
```

Refresh. Yeah, it's not great (yet), but the template inheritance is working and we can stay nice and DRY.

## 9. Including Static Files in a Template

As you know, web apps usually have static files such as `.css`, `.js`, image files, etc.

If we want Cat Collector to look better, we're going to have to be able to define some custom CSS.

Django projects are pre-configured with a `'django.contrib.staticfiles'` app installed for the purpose of serving static files.

At the bottom of **settings.py**, there is a `STATIC_URL = 'static/'` variable that declares the name of the folder that will contain static files within Django apps.

We need that, so let's create it:

```
mkdir main_app/static
```

Next, let's create a folder within `static` dedicated to CSS:

```
mkdir main_app/static/css
```

Now let's create a `style.css`:

```
touch main_app/static/css/style.css
```

Just to make sure that **style.css** is properly loaded, let's put in a touch of hideous CSS:

```css
body {
  background-color: red;
}
```

We also have to update **base.html** by first adding the `load` template tag at the top:

```html
{% load static %}

<!DOCTYPE html>
```

Finally, add this `<link>` below the Materialize CDN:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="{% static 'css/style.css' %}">
```

The `static` DTL template tag ensures that the correct URL is assigned to the `href`.

> ðŸ‘€ Django caches templates & statics, so we'll need to restart the server!

Refresh - and red city tells us that **style.css** is being loaded.  Let's update it with the following more pleasing CSS:

```css
body {
  display: flex;
  min-height: 100vh;
  flex-direction: column;
}

main {
  flex: 1 0 auto;
}

footer.page-footer {
  padding-top: 0;
  text-align: right;
}
```

That's better!

## 10. Rendering Data in a Template

To see how data is rendered dynamically using Django templating, we're going to implement the following user story:

> _As a User, when I click the **View All My Cats** link, I want to see a page listing all of my cats._

Luckily the [process of how to add a feature to a web application](https://gist.github.com/jim-clark/9f9bd19d60d9ce2ec57be8242b6aee96) from the previous unit you had tattooed applies to all web frameworks!

### Step 1 - Identify the "Proper" Route

Although Django's URL-based routing doesn't follow the RESTful routing methodology, we can still rely on our training thus far and use similar paths when possible.

RESTful routing calls for a path of `/cats` when we want to see all cats - so we'll go with it!

### Step 2 - Create the UI

For the UI, it makes sense to add the **View All My Cats** link to the navigation bar in **base.html**:

```html
<li><a href="/about">About</a></li>
<!-- new markup below -->
<li><a href="/cats">View All My Cats</a></li>
```

> ðŸ‘€ It's important to continue to use leading slashes in the HTML!

A quick refresh and we have our link:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/4DZVGiI.png">

### Step 3 - Define the Route

Now let's add the new route to **main_app/urls.py**:

```python
urlpatterns = [
  path('', views.home, name='home'),
  path('about/', views.about, name='about'),
  # route for cats index
  path('cats/', views.cats_index, name='index'),
]
```

We only have a single **views.py**, so by naming the view `cat_index` we're anticipating that there might be another _index_ view for a different resource in the future (_toys_ maybe?).

Of course, by referencing a nonexistent view, the server's not happy.

### Step 4 - Code the View

When working in Django, we'll just have to get used to calling _controller functions_ **views** instead.

Let's code the `cats_index` view inside of **views.py**:

```python
# Add new view
def cats_index(request):
  # We pass data to a template very much like we did in Express!
  return render(request, 'cats/index.html', {
    'cats': cats
  })
```

Two interesting things above:

1. We're namespacing the `index.html` template by putting it in a new `templates/cats` folder for organizational purposes - just like we did in Express.

2. Similar to how we passed data to a template in Express using a JS object, we pass a dictionary as a third positional argument in Django's `render` function.

#### We Need Some Cats!

In the next lesson, we'll create a `Cat` model but for now we're simply going to use a Python list containing a couple of "cat" dictionaries near the top of **views.py**:

```python
# views.py

# Add this cats list below the imports
cats = [
  {'name': 'Lolo', 'breed': 'tabby', 'description': 'furry little demon', 'age': 3},
  {'name': 'Sachi', 'breed': 'calico', 'description': 'gentle and loving', 'age': 2},
]
```

### Step 5 - Respond to the Client's HTTP Request

âœ… We've already written the code to respond using the `render()` method in the view.

However, we need to create the **cats/index.html** template currently being rendered.

First we need the `templates/cats` folder we'll use to organize cat related templates:

```
mkdir main_app/templates/cats
```

Now create the **cats/index.html** template file:

```
touch main_app/templates/cats/index.html
```

Now the fun stuff!

```html
{% extends 'base.html' %}
{% block content %}

<h1>Cat List</h1>

{% for cat in cats %}
  <div class="card">
    <div class="card-content">
      <span class="card-title">{{ cat.name }}</span>
      <p>Breed: {{ cat.breed }}</p>
      <p>Description: {{ cat.description }}</p>
      {% if cat.age > 0 %}
        <p>Age: {{ cat.age }}</p>
      {% else %}
        <p>Age: Kitten</p>
      {% endif %}
    </div>
  </div>
{% endfor %}

{% endblock %}
```

There are two control flow template tag constructs you'll use quite a bit:

- The `{% for %}` / `{% endfor %}` block used to perform looping
- The `{% if %}` / `{% elif %} / {% else %} / {% endif %}` block used for branching.

> ðŸ‘€ Django template tags are designed to mimic their Python counterparts, however, they are not embedding Python the way EJS embedded JavaScript.  For example, Python does not have `endfor` or `endif` as part of the language.

The double curly brace syntax `{{}}` is used to print the values of variables and object properties.

If the property on an object is a method, it is automatically invoked by the template engine without any arguments and we **do not** put parenthesis after the method name.  For example, assuming a person object has a `getFullName` method, it would be printed like this `{{ person.getFullName }}` in the template. This is another example of how DTL is its own language and not Python.

Some of you have probably already clicked the link and are understandably grinning!

## 11. Summary

You now have a minimal but functional application that renders an **index** page that dynamically displays a hardcoded list of cats.

You now know pretty much all there is to know about the structure of a Django app!

In the next lesson we'll learn about Django Models where we'll code a `Cat` Model and use it to CRUD ðŸ˜¸ðŸ˜¸ðŸ˜¸ in the database!

## 12. Labs for Cat Collector Lessons

In this unit, the lab for each Django lesson will be to repeat everything done in the lesson, except you'll "collect" something else, like Finches, and call the project something like finchcollector, or whatever you are collecting ðŸ˜€

The final version of your "Finch Collector" will be a deliverable.

Because your completed Finch Collector project will be fairly comprehensive, it will likely make a nice addition to your portfolio.

Be sure to create your project within your **~/code** folder and push it to a repo in your personal GitHub account.
