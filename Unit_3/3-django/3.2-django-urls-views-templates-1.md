## 1. Learning Django Game Plan

We've got a great set of Django lessons coming your way!

The lessons will add features, piece-by-piece, to a modern full-stack reference app named **Cat Collector**.

Let me show you the final version we're going to build this week.

Then, after the lessons, you will use lab time to repeat what you saw in the lesson by building your own app named anything you want, say - **Finch Collector**.

Here's an overview of the high-level topics we'll be covering, in order:

1. Django URLs, Views, and Templates
2. Data Models and Migrations
3. Django Class-based Views
4. One-to-Many Models & ModelForms
5. Many-to-Many Models
6. Uploading Images to the Cloud
7. Django Authentication

Let's get on with part 1...

## 2. Review the Request/Response Cycle in Django

Once again, let's review the following diagram that shows how a request flows through a Django project:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/1fFg7lz.png">

The Request/Response Cycle in Django is the same as in Express in that:

- Clicking links and submitting forms on the front-end (browser) sends HTTP requests to the web app running on a web server.
- The web app has a routing mechanism that matches HTTP requests to code.
- That code typically performs CRUD, then either:
	- Renders dynamic templates for Read data operations.
	- Redirects the browser in the case of Create, Update or Delete data operations. 

## 3. Start the **Cat Collector** Project

### Create the database

Databases are not automatically created by Django.

Let's use the `createdb` command, installed with PostgreSQL, to create the database for the Cat Collector project:

```
createdb catcollector
```

Named using lowercase and ran together will work well.

> üëÄ A `dropdb` command is also available for deleting databases from PostgreSQL.

### Start the Project

Let's put in a rep creating a Django project/app!


Move into your **~/code** folder:

```
cd ~/code
```

Run the following command to create the Django project:

```
django-admin startproject catcollector
```

The above command generated and configured a Django project in a folder named **catcollector** - move into it:

```
cd catcollector
```

Open the project folder in VS Code:

```
code .
```

Open an integrated Terminal and we're off to a great start...

### Create the App

A Django _project_ contains Django _apps_.

Django apps represent major functionality in a project, although you would typically create only a single app within the project.

Take a look at the `INSTALLED_APPS` list in **catcollector/settings.py**. Those pre-installed apps provide services such as the admin app and the ability to serve static files.

For Cat Collector, as well as for your project 3, you will need an app to implement the main functionality, in this case collecting cats üò∏

It makes sense to name the main app generically, so let's do it:

```
python3 manage.py startapp main_app
```

You'll now find a **main_app** folder within the top-level project folder. That folder has been configured to be a Python package which is a way to organize modules.

Let's include it as part of the Cat Collector project by adding it to the `INSTALLED_APPS` in **settings.py**:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
	'main_app',
	'django.contrib.admin',
	'django.contrib.auth',
	'django.contrib.contenttypes',
	'django.contrib.sessions',
	'django.contrib.messages',
	'django.contrib.staticfiles',
]
```

Let's check to make sure the project starts up:

```
python3 manage.py runserver
```

Ignore the red message about unapplied migrations, we'll take care of those in a bit.

Browse to `localhost:8000` and make sure you see the rocket on the page:

### Connecting to the Database

Earlier we created a dedicated `catcollector` PostgreSQL database.

A Django project's configuration lives in **settings.py**. Let's update it to use our `catcollector` database:

```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': 'catcollector',
        # 'HOST': 'localhost',  <-- some computers might need this line
    }
}
```

> üëÄ By default, Django uses SQLite, a lightweight database that is not recommended for deployment.

We'll continue to the red unapplied migration message if the project successfully connected to the `catcollector` database. 

### Migrating the Pending Migrations

We use migrations to update the database's schema over time to meet the project's needs.

There are several migrations **pending**, i.e., just waiting to be applied to the database - let's do it: 

```
python3 manage.py migrate
```

We will cover migrations in more detail in the next lesson.

Nice - no more pending migrations!

Now let's code our first feature: a HOME page.

## 4. Add the GitHub Remote to Sync With

### Connect to the Remote

Let's connect to a remote repo that you can sync with just in case you can't resolve typos within a reasonable amount of time:

1. `git init`
2. `git add -A`
3. `git commit -m "Initial commit"`
4. `git remote add origin https://git.generalassemb.ly/sei-blended-learning/catcollector.git`
5. `git fetch --all`

<details>
<summary>
üëÄ Do you need to sync your code?
</summary>
<hr>

<code>git reset --hard origin/sync-1-setup</code>

<hr>
</details>

### Updating the Database After Syncing Code

It's possible that you may receive new or different migration files when syncing code.

Just in case, always attempt to apply any new migrations after syncing code:

```
python3 manage.py migrate
```

### Unable to Migrate Database Due to Errors

Unfortunately, it's possible that the newly synced with code can have migrations that are incompatible with previously applied migrations.

If this is the case, the quickest fix is to delete the current database and create a new one.

> üëÄ The following steps will delete any existing data that you may have saved in your current database.

Run the following commands in Terminal (**only if necessary**) to delete & replace the current database if having issues after syncing your code:

1. `dropdb <database name>`
2. `createdb <database name>`
3. `python3 manage.py migrate`
4. `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`<br>(you'll learn about this next lesson)

## 5. Defining Routes (URLs)

Just like with Express, there needs to be a route defined that matches each HTTP request coming from the browser.

<details>
<summary>
‚ùì What kind of error will we receive when there is no route defined that matches a given HTTP request? 
</summary>
<hr>

404 Not Found

<hr>
</details>

But, let's not forget that Django's routing system only cares about the URL (path) of the request and ignores the HTTP method.

For the HOME page functionality, we'll use the root route (`http://localhost:8000`) - let's see how...

### One-time URL Setup

In Django, routes are defined within modules named **urls.py**.

There's an existing project **catcollector/urls.py** that we could add additional routes to, but it's a best practice for each Django app to define its own and **include** those URLs in the project's.

> üëÄ There are some helpful comments at the top of **catcollector/urls.py**.

Start by setting up **main_app**'s own **urls.py**:

1. Create the **urls.py** module:

	```
	touch main_app/urls.py
	```

2. Include it in the project's **catcollector/urls.py**

	```python
	from django.contrib import admin
	# Add the include function to the import
	from django.urls import path, include
	
	urlpatterns = [
	    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
	    # '' represents the "starts with" path
	    path('', include('main_app.urls')),
	]
	```

	Be sure to import the `include` function near the top.
	
	Each item in the `urlpatterns` list defines a URL-based route or, as in the case above, mounts the routes contained in another urls.py module.
	
	Similar to how Express appends paths defined in a router module to the path in `app.use`, the paths defined in `'main_app.urls'` will be appended to the path specified in the `include` function.
	
	You can close **catcollector/urls.py** since all routes we define from this point forward will be defined within **main_app/urls.py**.

3. Now for the boilerplate needed in **main_app/urls.py**:

	```python
	from django.urls import path
	from . import views
	
	urlpatterns = [
	
	]
	```

	We've imported the `path` function that will be used to define each route.
	
	We've also created the required `urlpatterns` list that will hold each route we define for `main_app`.

### Define `main_app`'s Home Page URL

With the setup done, we're ready to define the route to display the Home page.

In **main_app/urls.py**:

```python
urlpatterns = [
  path('', views.home, name='home'),
]
```

The above code defines a root route using an **empty string** and maps it to the `view.home` view function that does not exist yet - making the server unhappy.

The `name='home'` kwarg gives the route a names.  Naming a route is optional but is considered a best practice.  We will see how naming a route comes in handy later.

The Home page route has been defined!  On to the view...

## 6. Defining View Functions

<details>
<summary>
‚ùì What is the equivalent to a Django View Function in Express?
</summary>
<hr>

Controller Function

<hr>
</details>

In the route for the Home page we referenced a view function named `home`.

We will define all of the app's views in **main_app/views.py**.

Let's define the `home` view function and render a non-existing template:

```python
from django.shortcuts import render

# Define the home view
def home(request):
  # Include an .html file extension - unlike when rendering EJS templates
  return render(request, 'home.html')
```

All view functions need to define a positional parameter to accept the `request` object Django will be passing in.  This `request` object is very much like the `req` object we worked with in Express controller functions.

As expected, refreshing `localhost:8000` will cause an error complaining that the template does not exist:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/J9WKz5A.png">

A very helpful error - let's fix it...

## 7. Using Django Templates

By default, a Django project is configured to look for templates inside of a `templates` folder within each app's folder (`main_app` in this case).

Let's create that `templates` folder for `main_app` to hold all of its template files:

```
mkdir main_app/templates
```

### Create a `home.html` Template

Now we can easily solve our error by creating the missing template and adding a bit of HTML:

1. Create a **templates/home.html** file
2. Add the HTML boilerplate (`!` + `[tab]`)
3. Add a `<h1>Home</h1>` within the `<body>`

> üëÄ Unlike EJS templates, Django templates use the common `.html` file extension.

Yep, it's not fancy, but we've implemented a feature in Django! üòÄ
