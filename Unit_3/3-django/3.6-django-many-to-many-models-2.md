## 7. ðŸ’ª Practice Exercise (15 minutes)

Implement the following user story:

> **_AAU, when viewing the detail page for a cat, I want to be able to remove a toy from that cat_**

Hints:

- "Unassociating" a toy is VERY much the same process as the Associating process we just implemented.

- During the "test drive" we saw how to remove ðŸ˜€ an association.

## 8. Lab Assignment

Lab time is to be spent implementing the same feature in your Finch Collector project ðŸ¦œ

## 9. Further Study

Although Django automatically creates a "hidden" join table to implement a many-to-many relationship, there are times where it would be beneficial to be able to add additional attributes to that join table.

As an example, a `Ticket` Model provides the role of a join table between a `Concert` and a `Customer`:

```
Concert --< Ticket >-- Customer
```

In essence, a _Concert has many Customers through Tickets_

Further, a _Customer has many Concerts through Tickets_

Django includes a `through` kwarg to pull this type of relationship off.

```python
class Concert(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    # other attributes here
    
class Customer(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    # other attributes here
    concerts = models.ManyToManyField(Concert, through='Ticket')
    
class Ticket(models.Model):
	 seat = models.CharField(max_length=20)
	 # other attributes here
    concert = models.ForeignKey(Concert, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    customer = models.ForeignKey(Customer, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
```
