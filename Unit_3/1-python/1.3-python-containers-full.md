## 1. Setup

To test some of the examples and complete the exercises:
- Create a new Python-based [replit](https://replit.com/)
- Name it something like "Python Containers"

## 2. General Purpose Containers

As you've learned, applications frequently need to maintain collections of data.

We use a container data structures to hold these collections of data...

<details>
<summary>
‚ùì What did we use in JS to hold collections of data?
</summary>
<hr>

**`objects` and `arrays`** (although arrays are actually objects in JS)

<hr>
</details>

In this lesson, we're going to review the following Python built-in types commonly used as containers:

- [Dictionaries](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries)
- [Lists](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists)
- [Tuples](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#tuples-and-sequences)

## 3. Dictionaries

### Purpose

**Dictionaries** are to Python as **objects** are to JS.

A **dictionary** provides a container for `key: value` pairs.

In Python, we commonly refer to `key: value` pairs as **items** vs. **properties** as in JS.

Dictionaries have a class (type) of `dict`.

### Basic Syntax

As with objects in JS, a **dictionary** is created literally using curly braces:

```python
student = {
  'name': 'Maria',
  'course': 'SEI',
  'current_week': 7
} 
```

Unlike in JS, when strings are used as keys, they must be quoted.

### Features

Dictionaries are mutable:

- The values assigned to a key can be changed
- Additional items can be added
- Existing items can be deleted
 
Any immutable type can be used as a key, including _numbers_ and _tuples_ (which we'll cover in a bit), for example:

```python
option = 3

d = {
  option: 'three'
}
```

The above dictionary, `d`, has 1 item with a key of `3` that holds the value of `'three'`.  Note that the value of the `option` variable is "copied" as the key - thus no "link" to the `option` variable is created.

> üëÄ Only since version 3.6 does Python track the insertion order of items in a dictionary - so beware if you're relying on the order items are iterated upon.

### Getting and Setting Values

We always use **square bracket notation** to get and set an item's value:

```python
name = student['name']
print(name)
> Maria
student['name'] = 'Tina'
print(student['name'])
> Tina
```

Unlike JS, we can't access items in a Python dictionary using dot notation.

### The `get()` Method

When accessing a key that does not exist in a dictionary, a `KeyError` will be raised. 

<details>
<summary>
‚ùì What happens when we access a property that does not exist in a JS object? 
</summary>
<hr>

We'll receive a runtime exception called *keyError* and no value will be returned. 

<hr>
</details>

One option to avoid this error is to use the `get()` method:

```python
skills = student['skills']
> KeyError: 'skills'
print( student.get('skills') )
> None
# Provide a default value if key not in dictionary
print( student.get('skills', {'HTML': 5, 'JAVASCRIPT': 4}) )
> {'HTML': 5, 'JAVASCRIPT': 4}
```

The actual default value would of course depend on what makes sense for your app.

### The `in` Operator

Another way to avoid the `KeyError` is to use the `in` operator to check if the dictionary includes a certain key:

```python	
if 'course' in student:
  print( f"{student['name']} is enrolled in {student['course']}")
else:
  print( f"{student['name']} is not enrolled in a course")
```

The `in` operator always returns a boolean (`True` or `False`).

### Adding Items

Simply assigning to a key that does not exist will create a new item in the dictionary.

Let's add an item to `student`:

```python
student['age'] = 21
```

<details>
<summary>
‚ùì If an <code>'age'</code> item already existed, what would happen?
</summary>
<hr>

**It would be updated**

<hr>
</details>

### Deleting Items

The `del` statement is used to delete an item from a dictionary:

```python
del student['age']
# Verify that item was deleted
'age' in student
> False
```

> üëÄ A `del` statement does not return a value

### Number of Items

Use the built-in `len()` function to retrieve the number of items in a dictionary:

```python
print( student )
> {'name': 'Tina', 'course': 'SEI'}
len(student)
> 2
len({})
> 0
```

### Dictionaries - Iterating Items

`for...in` loops are used to iterate over the items in a dictionary. 

However, accessing the value of an item as follows is considered to be a Python [anti-pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-pattern):

```python
for key in student:
  print( f"{key} = {student[key]}" )
```
	
The preferred approach is to use the `items()` method to obtain a [dictionary view object](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dictionary-view-objects).

`student.items()` returns a wrapped list of (key, value) tuples:

```python
student.items()
> dict_items([('name', 'Tina'), ('course', 'SEI')])
```

Now we can use a `for...in` loop to iterate over the view object:

```python
for key, val in student.items():
  print( f"{key} = {val}" )
```

The `for` statement "unpacks" the tuples by assigning its values to multiple variables like with `key, val` above.

### üëâ You Do - Dictionary Practice Exercise <small>(10 mins)</small>

1. Define a Python dictionary named `where_my_things_are` containing a few items where:
	- the `keys` are things you have, and
	- the `values` are the locations you keep those things.

2. Write a `for...in` loop that iterates over the items in the dictionary and prints each one as<br>**_My [thing] is kept [location]_**

## 4. Lists

### Purpose

**Lists** are to Python as **arrays** are to JS.

A **list** provides a container for zero or more items (_elements_ in JS arrays).

**Lists** can contain items of different types, including dictionaries and nested lists.

**Lists** have a class (type) of `list`.

### Basic Syntax

Like arrays in JS, a **list** can be created literally with a set of **square brackets**:

```python
colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue']
```

The number of items in a list is returned using the built-in `len()` function:

```python
len(colors)
> 3
```

### Features

Lists are considered to be a _sequence_ type in Python. A _sequence_ is a generic term used for an **ordered** collection. Other _sequence_ types in Python include **strings** and **tuples**.

Lists are mutable:

- Existing items within a list can be updated
- Items can be added to a list
- Items can be removed from a list

### Accessing Items

Accessing the individual items of a list is much like accessing elements in a JS array, i.e., by using square bracket notation with an expression that evaluates to an integer:

```python
idx = 1
colors[idx + 1]
> blue
```

However, unlike in JS, we can use negative integers to index from the end of a list:

```python
colors[-1]
> blue
```

No need to write code like `colors[len(colors) - 1]` - yay!

### Assigning Items

We also use square brackets to target an item of a list for assignment:

```python
colors[-1] = 'brown'
print(colors)
> ['red', 'green', 'brown']
```

Unlike with JS arrays, assigning to a non-existing index results in an error:

```python
colors[10] = 'yellow'
> IndexError: list assignment index out of range
```

### Adding an Item

The equivalent to JS's `push()` method is `append()`:

```python
colors.append('purple')
```
	
However, unlike JS's `push()` method, `append()` can only add one item and does not return a value.

<details>
<summary>
‚ùì What does a JavaScript array's <code>push()</code> method return?
</summary>
<hr>

**The new length of the array**

<hr>
</details>
	
For adding multiple items, use the `extend()` method:

```python
colors.extend(['orange', 'black'])
```

or the `+=` operator:

```python
colors += ['orange', 'black']
```

The `+` operator can be used to create a **new list** by combining others:

```python
odds = [1, 3, 5]
evens = [2, 4, 6]
nums = odds + evens
print(nums)
> [1, 3, 5, 2, 4, 6]
```

### Inserting an Item

To add an item anywhere within a list, use the `insert()` method:

```python
print(colors)
> ['red', 'green', 'brown', 'purple', 'orange', 'black']
colors.insert(1, 'yellow')
> ['red', 'yellow', 'green', 'brown', 'purple', 'orange', 'black']
```

### Removing an Item

Yup, there's a `pop()` method, but it's more flexible in Python because you can specify the index of the item to remove and return:

```python
print(colors)
> ['red', 'yellow', 'green', 'brown', 'purple', 'orange', 'black']
green = colors.pop(2)
print(colors)
> ['red', 'yellow', 'brown', 'purple', 'orange', 'black']
```

If you don't care about the value returned by `pop()`, you can also use the `del` operator to delete an item:

```python
print(colors)
> ['red', 'yellow', 'brown', 'purple', 'orange', 'black']
del colors[1]
print(colors)
> ['red', 'brown', 'purple', 'orange', 'black']
```

Also there's a `remove()` method that removes the first item that matches what you pass in:

```python
print(colors)
> ['red', 'brown', 'purple', 'orange', 'black']
colors.remove('orange')
print(colors)
> ['red', 'brown', 'purple', 'black']
```

No value is returned by the `remove()` method.

### Clearing an Entire List

The `clear()` method does just what you'd think:

```python
print(colors)
> ['red', 'brown', 'purple', 'black']
colors.clear()
print(colors)
> []
```

### Iterating Over Items in a List

The `for...in` loop is used to iterate over the items in a list:

```python
colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue']
for color in colors:
  print(color)
> red
> green
> blue
```

If we need to access the index of the item while iterating over a list, we use the built-in `enumerate()` function to provide the index and the value to a `for...in` loop:

```python
for idx, color in enumerate(colors):
  print(idx, color)
> 0 red
> 1 green
> 2 blue
```

### üëâ You Do - Lists & Dictionary Practice Exercise <small>(10 mins)</small>

1. Define a list named `scores` that contains a dictionary with the following shape:
    ```python
    scores = [
      {
        'name': 'name of the player',
        'points': 25  # points the player scored
      }
    ]
    ```
2. Next, using `append()`, to add an additional "score" dictionary to the `scores` list.
3. Iterate over the items in the `scores` list and print a string with this format
    ```
    <name> scored <points> points
    ```
    for each dictionary item in the list.

## 5. List Comprehensions

### Purpose

[List comprehensions](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions) are a powerful feature in Python.

They provide a concise way to create and work with lists.

They will seem confusing as first, but they certainly are a favorite of Pythonistas and you will probably come across them when googling.

### Numerical Example

Say we needed to square all of the numbers in a list and put them into a new list, we might use a for loop like this:

```python
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
	
# I want 'n * n' for each 'n' in nums 
squares = []
for n in nums:
  squares.append(n * n)
print(squares)
> [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
```

<details>
<summary>
‚ùì What JS method would we use in this scenario?
</summary>
<hr>

**`map()`**

<hr>
</details>

A list comprehension can reduce this code:

```python
squares = []
for n in nums:
  squares.append(n * n)
```
To this:
	
```python
squares = [n * n for n in nums]
```

> üëÄ Again, a list comprehension always returns a **new** list.

### Basic Syntax

Here's the basic syntax of a list comprehension:

```python
# [<expression> for <item> in <list>]
# This reads as: I want <expression> for each <item> in <list>
```

As you can see, a list comprehension is basically a modified `for...in` loop within square brackets that returns a new list.

### Filtering the Items

We just saw how list comprehensions are a nice way to map a list, but they can be used for **filtering** too.

Again, let's start with a non-comprehension approach by using a `for...in` loop to map and filter `nums`:

```python
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
	
# I want 'n * n' for each 'n' in nums  if 'n * n' is even
even_squares = []
for n in nums:
  square = n * n 
  if square % 2 == 0:
    even_squares.append(square)
print(even_squares)
> [4, 16, 36, 64, 100]
```

Again list comprehensions reduce the above from:

```python
even_squares = []
for n in nums:
  square = n * n 
  if square % 2 == 0:
    even_squares.append(square)
```
To this one-liner:
	
```python
even_squares = [n * n for n in nums if (n * n) % 2 == 0]
```
Talk about less is more!

## 6. Tuples

**Tuples** in Python are very similar to Python **lists**.

Tuples have a class (type) of `tuple`.

You may come across tuple's being "classified" based on how many items they contain, e.g., a **2-tuple** would contain two items such as `(some_key, some_value)`.

### Basic Syntax

Tuples can be defined in a few different ways.  Most basically, they are defined like this:

```python
colors = ('red', 'green', 'blue')
print(colors)
> ('red', 'green', 'blue')
print( len(colors) )
> 3
``` 

The parentheses are actually optional.  The following would work as well:

```python
colors = 'red', 'green', 'blue'
```

However, using parenthesis seems to be the convention.

If you need to create a 1-tuple (a tuple with one item), be aware that a comma is necessary:

```python
# Will not create a tuple
hello_tuple = ('Hello')
print( type(hello_tuple) )
>  <class 'str'>

hello_tuple = ('Hello',)
# or just the following (no parens required)
hello_tuple = 'Hello',
print( type(hello_tuple) )
> <class 'tuple'>
```
	
### Differences Between Tuples & Lists

The main difference between tuples and lists is that tuples are immutable.

Since tuples can't be changed after they are created, they are great for protecting data that you don't want to be changed.

Tuples internally are "lighter weight" than lists and Python iterates over tuples faster than lists.

Because they are immutable, tuples can even be used as keys for dictionaries.

Generally, you'll find that tuples are used to contain heterogeneous (different) data types and lists for homogeneous (similar) data types.

### Accessing Items

Although tuples can't be modified like lists, we retrieve their items in the same way using square brackets:

```python
colors = ('red', 'green', 'blue')
green = colors[1]
print(green)
> green
```

_Sequences_ (lists, tuples & strings) also have an `index()` method that returns the index of the first match:

```python
colors = ('red', 'green', 'blue')
blue_idx = colors.index('blue')
print(blue_idx)
> 2
```

### Iteration

The items in tuples are iterated over by using `for...in` loops as we saw previously with lists:

```python
colors = ('red', 'green', 'blue')
for idx, color in enumerate(colors):
  print(idx, color)
> 0 red
> 1 green
> 2 blue
```

### Unpacking Tuples

Tuples (and other sequences such as lists & strings) have a convenient feature, called **unpacking**, for performing multiple variable assignments in a single line of code:

```python
colors = ('red', 'green', 'blue')
r, g, b = colors
print(r, g, b)
> red green blue
```

Comma separated variables on the left-side of the assignment operator and a sequence of values on the right is what it takes.

FYI, we were seeing unpacking in action within the `for in` loops above, for example:
 
```python
for key, val in student.items():
  print( f"{key} = {val}" )
```

## 7. Slicing (Copying) Sequences

Slicing in Python is used to create "slices" (copies) of sequences.

However, instead of using a `slice` method like we did in JS, Python has a cool "slice" operator that uses this syntax:

```python
a_sequence[m:n]
```

Just like with indexing, slicing uses square brackets, but adds a colon:

```python
short_name = 'Alexandria'[0:4]
print(short_name)
> Alex
```

Note that the slice includes up to, **but not including** the index to the right of the colon.

<details>
<summary>
‚ùì Is this the same as with the ending index in JS's <code>slice()</code> method?
</summary>
<hr>

**Yes!**

<hr>
</details>

If the first index is omitted, a default starting index of `0` is used:

```python
colors = ('red', 'green', 'blue')
print( colors[:2] )
> ('red', 'green')
```
 
If the up to index is omitted, the slice copies the sequence all the way to the end:

```python
colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue']
print( colors[1:] )
> ['green', 'blue']
```

Assuming the following code:

```python
fruit = ('apples', 'bananas', 'oranges')
fruits = fruit[:]
```

<details>
<summary>
‚ùì What would the value of <code>fruits</code> be?
</summary>
<hr>

```python
('apples', 'bananas', 'oranges')
```
Yes, an entire copy of the source tuple!

<hr>
</details>

### Slice Assignment in Lists

Amazingly, we can use the slice operator to insert and/or remove items in a list - similar to how JavaScript's `splice()` method can be used.

For example, assume this list:

```python
chars = ['a', 'b', 'x', 'y', 'd']
```

We could replace the `'x'` and `'y'` characters with `'c'` like this:

```python
chars = ['a', 'b', 'x', 'y', 'd']
chars[2:4] = 'c'
print(chars)
> ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
```

Notice how our resulting list is smaller than our original list, this is due to python not changing each item within from our range, but instead, replacing the entire range provided(2-4) of our list with a single value, this means we removed items at index locations 2, 3, and 4 and replaced those three items with a single item, 'c'. 

## 8. Python Containers Summary

Python's **dictionary**, **list** and **tuple** are the most common data types used as containers for collections of data.

In addition, Python offers amazing power, convenience and readability with features such as list comprehensions and slicing.

However, as usual, it takes practice to become "comfortable" with these concepts, so on to the lab, but first...

## 9. ‚ùì Essential Questions <small>(1 minute)</small>

<details>
<summary>
(1) What is the practical difference between a list and a tuple.
</summary>
<hr>

**Unlike lists, tuples are immutable** (cannot be changed)

<hr>
</details> 

```python
fruit = {
  'apples': 'red',
  'bananas': 'yellow',
  'oranges': 'orange'
}

color_of_bananas = fruit.bananas
```

<details>
<summary>
(2) What's the problem with the above code?
</summary>
<hr>

On this line of code:
```python
color_of_bananas = fruit.bananas
```
The `fruit.bananas` won't work because we have to use square bracket notation, such as:
```python
color_of_bananas = fruit['bananas']
```

<hr>

```python
one, two, three = 'abc'
```
<details>
<summary>
(3) What concept is being used above to assign values to the variables and what would the value of <code>two</code> be?
</summary>
<hr>

The concept is known as **unpacking**.

The value of `two` would be `'b'`
