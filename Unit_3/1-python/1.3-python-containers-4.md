### ðŸ‘‰ You Do - Lists & Dictionary Practice Exercise <small>(10 mins)</small>

1. Define a list named `scores` that contains a dictionary with the following shape:
    ```python
    scores = [
      {
        'name': 'name of the player',
        'points': 25  # points the player scored
      }
    ]
    ```
2. Next, using `append()`, to add an additional "score" dictionary to the `scores` list.
3. Iterate over the items in the `scores` list and print a string with this format
    ```
    <name> scored <points> points
    ```
    for each dictionary item in the list.
