## 1. Setup

We'll be writing code in [repl.it](https://repl.it):
- Create a Python-based repl
- Name it something like "Python Classes"

## 2. Review of OOP

Python is an **object-oriented programming (OOP) language**.

Object-oriented programming is characterized by programming with **objects** that represent the real-world objects of the application.

Classes are like "blueprints" and are used to create objects.

A key principle of OOP we discussed during the JS Classes lesson is **encapsulation**...

The bundling of related properties (attributes) and methods (behavior) together in an object.

#### Objects in Python

As you've already heard, everything in Python is an object.

This means is that every Python variable or piece of data has attributes and/or methods encapsulated within the object.

Python provides a `dir()` function that can be used to list an object's members (attributes and methods):

```python
# create a list
nums = [1, 2, 3]
# print the attributes & methods nums has
print( dir(nums) )
```

Some of the members like `append` & `pop` might look familiar.

The other methods that start and end with double-underscores, are called [_magic_ (or _dunder_) methods](https://rszalski.github.io/magicmethods/). They are internal methods most commonly used to _overload_ operators. If you would like to learn more about them, be sure to check out the link in the Further Study section.

We'll be using the `__init__` dunder method shortly. 

When we start working with Django, we'll be defining quite a few classes, so let's see how to we do it...

## 3. Writing a basic Python `class`

Like many of you, I like dogs - let's define a `Dog` class to create doggies from!

I'll explain the code as we type it:

```python
class Dog():
  def __init__(self, name, age=0):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age

  def bark(self):
    print(f'{self.name} says woof!')
```

> The naming convention for Python classes is UpperCamelCasing - same as in JavaScript.

Python automatically calls the `__init__` magic method when a new dog is created.

`__init__` is short for "initialize" because the method is used to initialize the properties of the new object.

<details>
<summary>
‚ùì What is the name of the method in JS classes responsible for initializing properties?
</summary>
<hr>

<code>constructor()</code>

<hr>
</details>

The `age=0` in `__init__`'s parameter list is called a _default parameter_ and will be assigned the the result of the expression to the right of the `=` if the function is called without an argument for that positional parameter.

The attributes for a dog instance are `name` and `age`.

`bark` is an _instance_ method in this Dog class.

<details>
<summary>
‚ùì What's an <strong>instance</strong> method?
</summary>
<hr>

A method that is callable on an instance of a class, i.e., object

<hr>
</details>

### What's this `self` business?

In the JS lesson about the `this` keyword, it was mentioned that every OOP language must have the same or similar mechanism as `this` to be able to:

- Enable a method to access the other properties/methods in an object, and
- Enable a single-copy of a method in memory to serve any number of instances.

JavaScript, Java, C++, C#, and others call it `this`.

Ruby, Swift and others call it `self`.

However, in Python, only by convention is it called `self` because it's just a parameter name...

Take a look at the `__init__` and `bark` method definitions, notice how the first parameter is named `self`.

When we write code like `spot.bark()`, the object to the left of the dot is automatically passed by Python as the first argument.

This is how Python provides a method's "context" in both instance and class methods!

## 4. Creating Objects by Instantiating a Class

By defining the `Dog` class, we now know the structure that each of the pooches will have!

Let's make a dog:

```python
spot = Dog('Spot', 8)

print(spot) # -> similar to <__main__.Dog object at 0x7f27bad2c208>

# print the name and age attributes of the spot object
print(spot.name, spot.age) # -> Spot 8

# invoke the spot object's bark instance method
spot.bark() # -> Spot says woof!
```

> üëÄ KEY POINT:  Unlike Python dictionaries that use **square bracket notation** to access/set its items' values, objects instantiated by our own Python classes are more like JS objects in that they use **dot notation** instead.

Let's try out the default parameter for a new dog's `age`:

```python
dog = Dog('Lassie')

print(dog.name, dog.age) # -> Lassie 0
```

## 5. Overriding Methods

As we just saw above, when we used `print(spot)` to print the `spot` object, a not so helpful string was outputted.

We can change this behavior by _overriding_ the `__str__` method that the `print` function calls automatically to obtain the string to print out.

Let's modify the `Dog` class to override the `__str__` method:

```python
class Dog():
  def __init__(self, name, age=0):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age

  def bark(self):
    print(f'{self.name} says woof!')
    
  def __str__(self):
    return f'Dog named {self.name} is {self.age} years old'
```

Let's try it out:

```python
spot = Dog('Spot', 8)

print(spot) # -> Dog named Spot is 8 years old
```
