## 1. Setup

To practice with the code in this lesson:
- Create a new Python-based repl in [repl.it](https://repl.it)
- Name it something like "Python Functions"

## Review the Use Case of Functions - What & Why?

Let's review the use case of functions...

<details>
<summary>
❓ What is a function?
</summary>
<hr>

**A function is a block of code that can be called with inputs and optionally returns an output.**

<hr>
</details>

<details>
<summary>
❓ Why are functions necessary in development?
</summary>
<hr>

**Functions provide:**

- Code organization/modularization
- Code reusability
- Readability (when functions are appropriately named)

<hr>
</details>

Functions are the building blocks of programming and all programming languages have them, including Python...

## 3. Defining Functions in Python

Here's how we define a basic function in Python:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/pixhxbF.png">

As you can see:

- The first line starts with the `def` keyword. This defines a function.
- The next word is the name (identifier) of the function.
- Following that is a parameter list inside parentheses.
- The first line ends with a colon.
- The first line is followed by an indented code block that we have become familiar with.
- Python functions, like JS, optionally return a value using a `return` statement.

## 4. A Minimal Function in Python

In JavaScript, we often would "stub up" an "empty" function temporarily:

```js
function someFunction() {

}
```

The following is how we would "stub up" a function in Python:

```python
def first_function():
  pass
```

The `pass` statement is simply a "do nothing" statement and is useful here to create a function that has at least one statement in its block, which is a requirement. 

<details>
<summary>
❓ What does a JS function return by default if it doesn't include a return statement?
</summary>
<hr>

**`undefined`**

<hr>
</details>

Let's see what a Python function returns by default:

```python
def first_function():
  pass

# Assign value returned by default
result = first_function()
print(result)
``` 

Good guess!

## 5. Key Differences Between Python & JS Functions

Besides the obvious syntactical differences, here are a few other things to be aware of...

#### Python functions are similar to function declarations in JS (not function expressions)

Functions in Python are defined using the `def` keyword.

Unlike JS's function expressions, they cannot be assigned to variables at the time they are being defined:

```python
# This will not work
my_function = def my_function():
  pass
```

However, after being defined, they can be assigned to variables, referenced by dictionaries/lists, etc.

For example, here's how you could dynamically "select" which function to call using a dictionary instead of a potentially huge `if...elif...else` statement:

```python
def add(a, b):
  return a + b

def subtract(a, b):
  return a - b

math_operations = {
  '+': add,
  '-': subtract
}

selected_operation = '+'

math_operations[selected_operation](2, 4)
> 6
```

#### Python has `lambda` functions instead of arrow functions

Python `lambda` functions are very much like _Arrow Functions_ in JavaScript:  

- They implicitly return a single expression's value.
- They are expressions so they are commonly used as "inline" arguments.
- They can be assigned to a variable.

However, unlike arrow functions, they cannot have any code block - just a single expression that has its result implicitly returned.

For example:

```js
// JavaScript
const nums = [1, 3, 2, 6, 5];
let odds = nums.filter(num => num % 2);
```
	
```python
# Python
nums = [1, 3, 2, 6, 5]
odds = list( filter(lambda num: num % 2, nums) )
```

Lambda functions are nifty when using Python functions such as `map()` and `filter()` - just like how arrow functions are nifty when using array iterator methods.

#### Python does not "hoist" functions

A key difference between Python and JavaScript functions is that you cannot invoke a Python function before the code that defines it:

```python
# Will cause an error - must call function AFTER it has been defined
add(5, 10)

def add(a, b):
  return a + b
```

## 6. Calling Functions

In Python, calling functions is the same as it is in JavaScript:

```python
def add(a, b):
  return a + b
  
def sub(a, b):
  return a - b

def compute(a, b, op):
  return op(a, b)

print( compute(1, 2, add) )
```

Yup, functions in Python can be passed to other functions - **callbacks** exist in Python!

Let's learn more about Python's **parameters** & **arguments**...

## 7. Parameters & Arguments

Just like in JS, **parameters** are the placeholders for passing input to a function.

However, Python has more options when defining parameters.

```python
# a & b are parameters
def add(a, b):
  return a + b
```

Also like JS, the values/expressions passed to a function when calling it are known as **arguments**:

```python
num = 5

# num & 10 are arguments
add(num, 10)
```

However, unlike JavaScript, Python requires that the correct number of arguments be provided when calling a function. For example:

```python
def add(a, b):
  return a + b
  
add()
  
# Generates the following error:
# TypeError: add() missing 2 required positional arguments: 'a' and 'b'
```

### Accepting a varying number of arguments

In JavaScript, we were able to access "extra" arguments being passed in to a function by using the `arguments` keyword:

```js
// Using the arguments special variable
function sum() {
  let total = 0;
  for (arg of arguments) total += arg;
  return total;
}

console.log( sum(1, 5, 10) );  // -> 16
```

Or preferably by using ES2015's _rest parameters_:

```js
function sum(...nums) {
  return nums.reduce((sum, num) => sum + num, 0);
}

console.log( sum(1, 5, 10) );  // -> 16
```

#### Python's `*` Parameter Specifier (`*args`)

Using the `*` ("star") specifier in a parameter list allows us to pass in a varying number of **positional** arguments into a function:

```python
def fn(*args):
  print( type(args) )
  for arg in args:
    print(arg)

fn(1, 2, 'SEI')
''' Output:
<class 'tuple'>
1
2
SEI
'''
```

The identifier used with `*`, i.e., `args`, can be anything, however **by convention, use `args`**.

Always use the `*args` parameter **after** any **required** positional parameters. For example:

```python
def dev_skills(dev_name, *args):
  dev = {'name': dev_name, 'skills': []}
  # args will be a tuple
  for skill in args:
    dev['skills'].append(skill)
  return dev

print(dev_skills('Alex', 'HTML', 'CSS', 'JavaScript', 'Python'))
# -> {'name': 'Alex', 'skills': ['HTML', 'CSS', 'JavaScript', 'Python']}
```

Or, why not use the `list()` function to convert the args tuple into a list...

```python
def dev_skills(dev_name, *args):
  dev = {'name': dev_name, 'skills': list(args)}
  return dev
```

#### Python's `**` Parameter Specifier (`**kwargs`)

First, the reason we name the parameter `kwargs` is because it stands for **keyword arguments**.

A **keyword argument** is an argument with a _name_, and this is why keyword arguments are also referred to as **named arguments**.

For example, assume the following function:

```python
def divide(a, b):
  return f'{a} divided by {b} is {a / b}'
```

Not that it's recommended, but knowing how the function is defined above, we could invoke the function using keyword arguments where the order of the arguments doesn't matter:

```python
divide(b=25, a=100) # returns '100 divided by 25 is 4.0'
```

However, the above example is not how keyword arguments are commonly used...

First, we use the `**` specifier when defining a parameter named `**kwargs` (named by convention).

By adding `**kwargs` at the **end of the parameter list**, we can access any number of keyword arguments. 

For example:

```python
def dev_skills(dev_name, **kwargs):
  # kwargs will be a dictionary!
  dev = {'name': dev_name, 'skills': kwargs}
  return dev

print(dev_skills('Jackie', HTML=5, CSS=3, JavaScript=4, Python=2))
```

#### Combining Required Positional, Optional Positional (`*args`) & Keyword (`**kwargs`) Arguments

You can use all three types of parameters in the same function, but they have to be defined in the following order:

```python
def arg_demo(pos1, pos2, *args, **kwargs):
  print(f'Positional params: {pos1}, {pos2}')
  print('*args:')
  for arg in args:
    print(' ', arg)
  print('**kwargs:')
  for keyword, value in kwargs.items():
    print(f'  {keyword}: {value}')

arg_demo('A', 'B', 1, 2, 3, color='purple', shape='circle')
```

Output:

```
Positional params: A, B
*args:
  1
  2
  3
**kwargs:
  color: purple
  shape: circle
```

```
A) No error, because we can add integers and floats together
B) Error, because we cannot "add" an integer to a string
C) Error, because we need to provide two arguments
D) No error, because we can "add" strings together
E) Error, because there are too many arguments
