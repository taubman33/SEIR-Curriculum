We'll be writing code in [repl.it](https://repl.it):
- Create a Python-based repl
- Name it something like "Python Classes"

## 2. Review of OOP

Python is an **object-oriented programming (OOP) language**.

Object-oriented programming is characterized by programming with **objects** that represent the real-world objects of the application.

**Classes are like "blueprints" and are used to create objects.**

<hr>
</details>

A key principle of OOP we discussed during the JS Classes lesson is **encapsulation**...

<details>

**The bundling of related properties (attributes) and methods (behavior) together in an object.**

<hr>
</details>

#### Objects in Python

As you've already heard, everything in Python is an object.

This means is that every Python variable or piece of data has attributes and/or methods encapsulated within the object.

Python provides a `dir()` function that can be used to list an object's members (attributes and methods):

```python
# create a list
nums = [1, 2, 3]
# print the attributes & methods nums has
print( dir(nums) )
```

Some of the members like `append` & `pop` might look familiar.

The other methods that start and end with double-underscores, are called [_magic_ (or _dunder_) methods](https://rszalski.github.io/magicmethods/). They are internal methods most commonly used to _overload_ operators. If you would like to learn more about them, be sure to check out the link in the Further Study section.

We'll be using the `__init__` dunder method shortly. 

When we start working with Django, we'll be defining quite a few classes, so let's see how to we do it...

## 3. Writing a basic Python `class`

Like many of you, I like dogs - let's define a `Dog` class to create doggies from!

I'll explain the code as we type it:

```python
class Dog():
  def __init__(self, name, age=0):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age

  def bark(self):
    print(f'{self.name} says woof!')
```

> The naming convention for Python classes is UpperCamelCasing - same as in JavaScript.

Python automatically calls the `__init__` magic method when a new dog is created.

`__init__` is short for "initialize" because the method is used to initialize the properties of the new object.

<details>
<summary>
‚ùì What is the name of the method in JS classes responsible for initializing properties?
</summary>
<hr>

**`constructor()`**

<hr>
</details>

The `age=0` in `__init__`'s parameter list is called a _default parameter_ and will be assigned the the result of the expression to the right of the `=` if the function is called without an argument for that positional parameter.

The attributes for a dog instance are `name` and `age`.

`bark` is an _instance_ method in this Dog class.

<details>
<summary>
‚ùì What's an <strong>instance</strong> method?
</summary>
<hr>

**A method that is callable on an instance of a class, i.e., object**

<hr>
</details>

### What's this `self` business?

In the JS lesson about the `this` keyword, it was mentioned that every OOP language must have the same or similar mechanism as `this` to be able to:

- Enable a method to access the other properties/methods in an object, and
- Enable a single-copy of a method in memory to serve any number of instances.

JavaScript, Java, C++, C#, and others call it `this`.

Ruby, Swift and others call it `self`.

However, in Python, only by convention is it called `self` because it's just a parameter name...

Take a look at the `__init__` and `bark` method definitions, notice how the first parameter is named `self`.

When we write code like `spot.bark()`, the object to the left of the dot is automatically passed by Python as the first argument.

This is how Python provides a method's "context" in both instance and class methods!

## 4. Creating Objects by Instantiating a Class

By defining the `Dog` class, we now know the structure that each of the pooches will have!

Let's make a dog:

```python
spot = Dog('Spot', 8)

print(spot) # -> similar to <__main__.Dog object at 0x7f27bad2c208>

# print the name and age attributes of the spot object
print(spot.name, spot.age) # -> Spot 8

# invoke the spot object's bark instance method
spot.bark() # -> Spot says woof!
```

> üëÄ KEY POINT:  Unlike Python dictionaries that use **square bracket notation** to access/set its items' values, objects instantiated by our own Python classes are more like JS objects in that they use **dot notation** instead.

Let's try out the default parameter for a new dog's `age`:

```python
dog = Dog('Lassie')

print(dog.name, dog.age) # -> Lassie 0
```

## 5. Overriding Methods

As we just saw above, when we used `print(spot)` to print the `spot` object, a not so helpful string was outputted.

We can change this behavior by _overriding_ the `__str__` method that the `print` function calls automatically to obtain the string to print out.

Let's modify the `Dog` class to override the `__str__` method:

```python
class Dog():
  def __init__(self, name, age=0):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age

  def bark(self):
    print(f'{self.name} says woof!')
    
  def __str__(self):
    return f'Dog named {self.name} is {self.age} years old'
```

Let's try it out:

```python
spot = Dog('Spot', 8)

print(spot) # -> Dog named Spot is 8 years old
```

Let's practice creating another class!

### üí™ Practice Exercise - Create a Class <small>(15 min)</small>

**At the top of the repl, define a class named `Vehicle` with the following members:**
- **`make`**: Attribute for the vehicle's make
- **`model`**: Attribute for the vehicle's model
- **`running`**: Attribute for maintaining whether or not the vehicle is "running".  Initialize `self.running` to a default of `False` within the `__init__` method instead of relying on a value being passed in as an argument.
- **`start()`**: Method that sets the `running` attribute to `True` and prints "**running...**".
- **`stop()`**: Method that sets the `running` attribute to `False` and prints "**stopped...**".


**Override the `__str__` method so that it returns a string formatted as:**

```
Vehicle is a <make> model <model> 
```

**After defining the `Vehicle` class, instantiate the class and assign the returned object to a variable named `car`.** For example:

```python
car = Vehicle('Tesla', 'Model S')
```

**Test out the class in the console:**

- Run the Repl
- Take `car` for a test drive (see below)

Example test drive:

```
> print(car.make, car.model)
Tesla Models S
> print(car)
Vehicle is a Tesla model Model S
> print(car.running)
False
> car.start()
Running...
> car.running
True
>car.stop()
Stopped...
```

üëâ Please submit the link to your Repl in the provided input.

```python
class Vehicle():
  def __init__(self, make, model):
    self.make = make
    self.model = model
    self.running = False

  def start(self):
    self.running = True
    print('Running...')

  def stop(self):
    self.running = False
    print('Stopped...')

  def __str__(self):
    return f'Vehicle is a {self.make} model {self.model}'

car = Vehicle('Tesla', 'Model S')
```

<hr>
</details>

## 6. Class vs. Instance Members

In Python, **instance** attributes & methods (members) are intended to be accessed/invoked by instances of the class, whereas, **class** members are intended to be accessible on the class only, not an instance.

This means the class attributes are shared with all instantiations of the Dog class, while instance variables are only usable within the instance, or current instantiation, of a given Dog class.

Each object has its own copy of its instance attributes, e.g., `name`. However, class attributes/methods are shared by all instances of that class.

To demonstrate class attributes, let's add a `next_id` class attribute to the `Dog` class that can be used to assign an `id` to each dog object:

```python
class Dog():
  # class attribute
  next_id = 1

  # updated __init__
  def __init__(self, name, age=0):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age
    self.id = Dog.next_id
    Dog.next_id += 1

  def bark(self):
    print(f'{self.name} says woof!')

  # updated __str__
  def __str__(self):
    return f'Dog ({self.id}) named {self.name} is {self.age} years old'
```

Note how the `Dog.next_id` class attribute is being accessed within the `__init__` method.

> üëÄ Technically, instances can also access class members via `self` due to the fact that Python will look for a member on the class if it first doesn't find it on the instance.

Now let's make sure it worked :)

```python
spot = Dog('Spot', 8)
print(spot)
pup = Dog('Lassie')
print(pup)
```

Cool, now let's see how class methods are created by adding a `get_total_dogs` method.

Add this to the bottom of the `Dog` class:

```python
  def __str__(self):
    return f'Dog ({self.id}) named {self.name} is {self.age} years old'
  
  # new code below
  @classmethod
  def get_total_dogs(cls):
    # cls represents the Dog class
    return cls.next_id - 1
```

There's only two differences when defining a class method:

1. The `@classmethod` _decorator_
2. The naming convention of the first parameter is to use `cls` instead of `self`

> üëÄ _Decorators_ in programming are a form of _metaprogramming_ (when a program has knowledge of, or manipulates itself).  In Python, decorators are used to modify the behavior of a function or class. They are not very common, but there's a link in the Further Study section if you'd like to learn more about decorators in Python.

Let's test out the new class method:

```python
spot = Dog('Spot', 8)
pup = Dog('Lassie')

# class methods are called on the class, not an instance
print(Dog.get_total_dogs())  # -> 2
```

## 7. Inheritance

Maybe the following graphic will jog your memory in regards to what **inheritance** is:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/MvXw4nD.gif">

Using inheritance, a **subclass** automatically inherits all of the attributes and methods of its **superclass**.

The **subclass** can then define additional attributes and/or methods to make a more _specialized_ class than the superclass.

For example, in the JS Classes lesson, we specialized the `Square` class by _extending_ it to create an `ImageSquare` subclass.

Let's see how inheritance is implemented in Python by creating a `ShowDog` class that specializes the `Dog` class:

```python
# Pass in superclass as argument
class ShowDog(Dog):
  # Add additional parameters AFTER those in the superclass
  def __init__(self, name, age=0, total_earnings=0):
    # Always call the superclass's __init__ first
    Dog.__init__(self, name, age)
    # Now add any new attributes
    self.total_earnings = total_earnings
  
  # Add additional methods
  def add_prize_money(self, amount):
    self.total_earnings += amount
    print(f'{self.name}\'s new total earnings are {self.total_earnings}')
```

> üëÄ If not specified, the default superclass is Python's `object` class. In JS, it was the `Object` class.

It's show time!

```python
winky = ShowDog('Winky', 3, 1000)
print(winky) # Yay, inherited the overridden __str__
winky.bark() # Yay, inherited the bark method
print(winky.total_earnings) # -> 1000
winky.add_prize_money(500) # New method that 'Dogs' don't have
print(winky.total_earnings) # -> 1500
```

Inheritance is critical to OOP languages. In fact, they even have their own **object hierarchies**.  Check this out:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/GC3UE9l.jpg">

Frameworks like Django and Rails have elaborate object hierarchies of their own.  For example, when we move on to Django, we'll be defining Models by inheriting from a Django class like this:

```python
class Person(models.Model):
```

That was fun!

FYI, here's [the link to my Repl](https://replit.com/@SEIStudent/Python-Classes#main.py) for this lesson.

## 9. Optional Practice Exercise

Looking for some practice building an object hierarchy in Python?  Good!

In a separate Python repl...

Create a `BankAccount` class with the following members:

- **`owner`**: (attribute) The owner's name as a string
- **`balance`**: (attribute) The amount of money in the account
- **`account_no`**: (attribute) A number to be randomly generated and assigned within `__init__` - not passed in at time of instantiation
- **`deposit(amount)`**: (method) When called on an instance, increases the `balance` by the `amount` argument and returns the new balance
- **`withdraw(amount)`**: (method) When called on an instance, decreases the `balance` by the `amount` argument and returns the new balance

Here's how to generate a random integer for the in Python:

```python
# Put this line at the top of the repl
import random

# Use this inside of BankAccount's __init__ to generate
# a random account number from 111111111 to 999999999
self.account_no = random.randint(111111111, 999999999)
```

Create two instances, make both deposits and withdrawals, and print the attributes to test them out.

#### Bonus 1

Override the `__str__` method to return the following formatted string:

```
Account <account_no> / Balance: xxxxx.xx
```

#### Bonus 2

Create a `SavingsAccount` class that subclasses `BankAccount` and specializes it so that the `withdraw` method no longer accepts any argument, does not change the balance, and returns a string of `No withdrawals permitted`.

#### Bonus 3

Add an additional `has_overdraft` attribute to the `BankAccount` class that accepts `True` or `False` at the time of instantiation, but defaults to `False` if not passed in (hint: review default parameters discussed above).

When the `withdraw` method is called, do not allow the withdraw if the amount being withdrawn is greater than `balance`, unless `has_overdraft` is `True`.  `withdraw` should continue to return the `balance`.
