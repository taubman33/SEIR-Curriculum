### ðŸ’ª Practice Exercise - Create a Class <small>(15 min)</small>

**At the top of the repl, define a class named `Vehicle` with the following members:**
- **`make`**: Attribute for the vehicle's make
- **`model`**: Attribute for the vehicle's model
- **`running`**: Attribute for maintaining whether or not the vehicle is "running".  Initialize `self.running` to a default of `False` within the `__init__` method instead of relying on a value being passed in as an argument.
- **`start()`**: Method that sets the `running` attribute to `True` and prints "**running...**".
- **`stop()`**: Method that sets the `running` attribute to `False` and prints "**stopped...**".


**Override the `__str__` method so that it returns a string formatted as:**

```
Vehicle is a <make> model <model> 
```

**After defining the `Vehicle` class, instantiate the class and assign the returned object to a variable named `car`.** For example:

```python
car = Vehicle('Tesla', 'Model S')
```

**Test out the class in the console:**

- Run the Repl
- Take `car` for a test drive (see below)

Example test drive:

```
> print(car.make, car.model)
Tesla Models S
> print(car)
Vehicle is a Tesla model Model S
> print(car.running)
False
> car.start()
Running...
> car.running
True
>car.stop()
Stopped...
```

## 6. Class vs. Instance Members

In Python, **instance** attributes & methods (members) are intended to be accessed/invoked by instances of the class, whereas, **class** members are intended to be accessible on the class only, not an instance.

Each object has its own copy of its instance attributes, e.g., `name`. However, class attributes/methods are shared by all instances of that class.

To demonstrate class attributes, let's add a `next_id` class attribute to the `Dog` class that can be used to assign an `id` to each dog object:

```python
class Dog():
  # class attribute
  next_id = 1

  # updated __init__
  def __init__(self, name, age=0):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age
    self.id = Dog.next_id
    Dog.next_id += 1

  def bark(self):
    print(f'{self.name} says woof!')

  # updated __str__
  def __str__(self):
    return f'Dog ({self.id}) named {self.name} is {self.age} years old'
```

Note how the `Dog.next_id` class attribute is being accessed within the `__init__` method.

> ðŸ‘€ Technically, instances can also access class members via `self` due to the fact that Python will look for a member on the class if it first doesn't find it on the instance.

Now let's make sure it worked :)

```python
spot = Dog('Spot', 8)
print(spot)
pup = Dog('Lassie')
print(pup)
```

Cool, now let's see how class methods are created by adding a `get_total_dogs` method.

Add this to the bottom of the `Dog` class:

```python
  def __str__(self):
    return f'Dog ({self.id}) named {self.name} is {self.age} years old'
  
  # new code below
  @classmethod
  def get_total_dogs(cls):
    # cls represents the Dog class
    return cls.next_id - 1
```

There's only two differences when defining a class method:

1. The `@classmethod` _decorator_
2. The naming convention of the first parameter is to use `cls` instead of `self`

> ðŸ‘€ _Decorators_ in programming are a form of _metaprogramming_ (when a program has knowledge of, or manipulates itself).  In Python, decorators are used to modify the behavior of a function or class. They are not very common, but there's a link in the Further Study section if you'd like to learn more about decorators in Python.

Let's test out the new class method:

```python
spot = Dog('Spot', 8)
pup = Dog('Lassie')

# class methods are called on the class, not an instance
print(Dog.get_total_dogs())  # -> 2
```

## 7. Inheritance

Maybe the following graphic will jog your memory in regards to what **inheritance** is:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/MvXw4nD.gif">

Using inheritance, a **subclass** automatically inherits all of the attributes and methods of its **superclass**.

The **subclass** can then define additional attributes and/or methods to make a more _specialized_ class than the superclass.

For example, in the JS Classes lesson, we specialized the `Square` class by _extending_ it to create an `ImageSquare` subclass.

Let's see how inheritance is implemented in Python by creating a `ShowDog` class that specializes the `Dog` class:

```python
# Pass in superclass as argument
class ShowDog(Dog):
  # Add additional parameters AFTER those in the superclass
  def __init__(self, name, age=0, total_earnings=0):
    # Always call the superclass's __init__ first
    Dog.__init__(self, name, age)
    # Now add any new attributes
    self.total_earnings = total_earnings
  
  # Add additional methods
  def add_prize_money(self, amount):
    self.total_earnings += amount
    print(f'{self.name}\'s new total earnings are {self.total_earnings}')
```

> ðŸ‘€ If not specified, the default superclass is Python's `object` class. In JS, it was the `Object` class.

It's show time!

```python
winky = ShowDog('Winky', 3, 1000)
print(winky) # Yay, inherited the overridden __str__
winky.bark() # Yay, inherited the bark method
print(winky.total_earnings) # -> 1000
winky.add_prize_money(500) # New method that 'Dogs' don't have
print(winky.total_earnings) # -> 1500
```

Inheritance is critical to OOP languages. In fact, they even have their own **object hierarchies**.  Check this out:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/GC3UE9l.jpg">

Frameworks like Django and Rails have elaborate object hierarchies of their own.  For example, when we move on to Django, we'll be defining Models by inheriting from a Django class like this:

```python
class Person(models.Model):
```

That was fun!

FYI, here's [the link to my Repl](https://replit.com/@SEIStudent/Python-Classes#main.py) for this lesson.

## 9. Optional Practice Exercise

Looking for some practice building an object hierarchy in Python?  Good!

In a separate Python repl...

Create a `BankAccount` class with the following members:

- **`owner`**: (attribute) The owner's name as a string
- **`balance`**: (attribute) The amount of money in the account
- **`account_no`**: (attribute) A number to be randomly generated and assigned within `__init__` - not passed in at time of instantiation
- **`deposit(amount)`**: (method) When called on an instance, increases the `balance` by the `amount` argument and returns the new balance
- **`withdraw(amount)`**: (method) When called on an instance, decreases the `balance` by the `amount` argument and returns the new balance

Here's how to generate a random integer for the in Python:

```python
# Put this line at the top of the repl
import random

# Use this inside of BankAccount's __init__ to generate
# a random account number from 111111111 to 999999999
self.account_no = random.randint(111111111, 999999999)
```

Create two instances, make both deposits and withdrawals, and print the attributes to test them out.

#### Bonus 1

Override the `__str__` method to return the following formatted string:

```
Account <account_no> / Balance: xxxxx.xx
```

#### Bonus 2

Create a `SavingsAccount` class that subclasses `BankAccount` and specializes it so that the `withdraw` method no longer accepts any argument, does not change the balance, and returns a string of `No withdrawals permitted`.

#### Bonus 3

Add an additional `has_overdraft` attribute to the `BankAccount` class that accepts `True` or `False` at the time of instantiation, but defaults to `False` if not passed in (hint: review default parameters discussed above).

When the `withdraw` method is called, do not allow the withdraw if the amount being withdrawn is greater than `balance`, unless `has_overdraft` is `True`.  `withdraw` should continue to return the `balance`.
