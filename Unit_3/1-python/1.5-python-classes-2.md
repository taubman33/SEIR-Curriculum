### ðŸ’ª Practice Exercise - Create a Class <small>(15 min)</small>

**At the top of the repl, define a class named `Vehicle` with the following members:**
- **`make`**: Attribute for the vehicle's make
- **`model`**: Attribute for the vehicle's model
- **`running`**: Attribute for maintaining whether or not the vehicle is "running".  Initialize `self.running` to a default of `False` within the `__init__` method instead of relying on a value being passed in as an argument.
- **`start()`**: Method that sets the `running` attribute to `True` and prints "**running...**".
- **`stop()`**: Method that sets the `running` attribute to `False` and prints "**stopped...**".


**Override the `__str__` method so that it returns a string formatted as:**

```
Vehicle is a <make> model <model> 
```

**After defining the `Vehicle` class, instantiate the class and assign the returned object to a variable named `car`.** For example:

```python
car = Vehicle('Tesla', 'Model S')
```

**Test out the class in the console:**

- Run the Repl
- Take `car` for a test drive (see below)

Example test drive:

```
> print(car.make, car.model)
Tesla Models S
> print(car)
Vehicle is a Tesla model Model S
> print(car.running)
False
> car.start()
Running...
> car.running
True
>car.stop()
Stopped...
```

ðŸ‘‰ Please submit the link to your Repl in the provided input.
