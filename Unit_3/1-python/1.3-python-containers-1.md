## 1. Setup

To test some of the examples and complete the exercises:
- Create a new Python-based [replit](https://replit.com/)
- Name it something like "Python Containers"

## 2. General Purpose Containers

As you've learned, applications frequently need to maintain collections of data.

We use a container data structures to hold these collections of data...

<details>
<summary>
‚ùì What did we use in JS to hold collections of data?
</summary>
<hr>

<strong><code>objects</code> and <code>arrays</code></strong> (although arrays are actually objects in JS)

<hr>
</details>

In this lesson, we're going to review the following Python built-in types commonly used as containers:

- [Dictionaries](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries)
- [Lists](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists)
- [Tuples](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#tuples-and-sequences)

## 3. Dictionaries

### Purpose

**Dictionaries** are to Python as **objects** are to JS.

A **dictionary** provides a container for `key: value` pairs.

In Python, we commonly refer to `key: value` pairs as **items** vs. **properties** as in JS.

Dictionaries have a class (type) of `dict`.

### Basic Syntax

As with objects in JS, a **dictionary** is created literally using curly braces:

```python
student = {
  'name': 'Maria',
  'course': 'SEI',
  'current_week': 7
} 
```

Unlike in JS, when strings are used as keys, they must be quoted.

### Features

Dictionaries are mutable:

- The values assigned to a key can be changed
- Additional items can be added
- Existing items can be deleted
 
Any immutable type can be used as a key, including _numbers_ and _tuples_ (which we'll cover in a bit), for example:

```python
option = 3

d = {
  option: 'three'
}
```

The above dictionary, `d`, has 1 item with a key of `3` that holds the value of `'three'`.  Note that the value of the `option` variable is "copied" as the key - thus no "link" to the `option` variable is created.

> üëÄ Only since version 3.6 does Python track the insertion order of items in a dictionary - so beware if you're relying on the order items are iterated upon.

### Getting and Setting Values

We always use **square bracket notation** to get and set an item's value:

```python
name = student['name']
print(name)
> Maria
student['name'] = 'Tina'
print(student['name'])
> Tina
```

Unlike JS, we can't access items in a Python dictionary using dot notation.

### The `get()` Method

When accessing a key that does not exist in a dictionary, a `KeyError` will be raised. 

<details>
<summary>
‚ùì What happens when we access a property that does not exist in a JS object? 
</summary>
<hr>

<code>undefined</code> is returned

<hr>
</details>

One option to avoid this error is to use the `get()` method:

```python
skills = student['skills']
> KeyError: 'skills'
print( student.get('skills') )
> None
# Provide a default value if key not in dictionary
print( student.get('skills', {'HTML': 5, 'JAVASCRIPT': 4}) )
> {'HTML': 5, 'JAVASCRIPT': 4}
```

The actual default value would of course depend on what makes sense for your app.

### The `in` Operator

Another way to avoid the `KeyError` is to use the `in` operator to check if the dictionary includes a certain key:

```python	
if 'course' in student:
  print( f"{student['name']} is enrolled in {student['course']}")
else:
  print( f"{student['name']} is not enrolled in a course")
```

The `in` operator always returns a boolean (`True` or `False`).

### Adding Items

Simply assigning to a key that does not exist will create a new item in the dictionary.

Let's add an item to `student`:

```python
student['age'] = 21
```

<details>
<summary>
‚ùì If an <code>'age'</code> item already existed, what would happen?
</summary>
<hr>

It would be updated

<hr>
</details>

### Deleting Items

The `del` statement is used to delete an item from a dictionary:

```python
del student['age']
# Verify that item was deleted
'age' in student
> False
```

> üëÄ A `del` statement does not return a value

### Number of Items

Use the built-in `len()` function to retrieve the number of items in a dictionary:

```python
print( student )
> {'name': 'Tina', 'course': 'SEI'}
len(student)
> 2
len({})
> 0
```

### Dictionaries - Iterating Items

`for...in` loops are used to iterate over the items in a dictionary. 

However, accessing the value of an item as follows is considered to be a Python [anti-pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-pattern):

```python
for key in student:
  print( f"{key} = {student[key]}" )
```
	
The preferred approach is to use the `items()` method to obtain a [dictionary view object](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dictionary-view-objects).

`student.items()` returns a wrapped list of (key, value) tuples:

```python
student.items()
> dict_items([('name', 'Tina'), ('course', 'SEI')])
```

Now we can use a `for...in` loop to iterate over the view object:

```python
for key, val in student.items():
  print( f"{key} = {val}" )
```

The `for` statement "unpacks" the tuples by assigning its values to multiple variables like with `key, val` above.
