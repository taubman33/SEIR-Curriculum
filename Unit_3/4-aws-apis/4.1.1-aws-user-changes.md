AWS has recently made changes to how to create an IAM User and obtain Access Keys beyond just the UI...

## "Specify User Details" Page

Be sure to uncheck the **Provide user access to the AWS Management Console**:

Do your best to follow the lesson to create the "django-s3-assets" group.

Creating access keys for the user has changed though...

## Creating Access Keys

After creating the new user, click the `[View user]` button:

Then click `[Next]`, etc. until you are presented with the **Access Key** and **Secret Access Key**.

❗️ Be sure to copy these keys when you are viewing them at this point because you will not be able to access them in the future.
